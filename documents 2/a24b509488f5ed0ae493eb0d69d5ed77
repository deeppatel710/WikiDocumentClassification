Baniszewski, two of her children, Paula and John, and two neighbor youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were charged and convicted of the crime.

<p>Sylvia Likens was the third child of carnival workers Betty and Lester Likens. Her birth came between two sets of <a href="/wiki/Fraternal_twins" title="Fraternal twins" class="mw-redirect">fraternal twins</a>, Diana and Daniel (two years older), and Jenny and Benny (one year younger). The marriage of the Likens was unstable and the family moved many times. Sylvia was often boarded out or forced to live with relatives while her parents were working.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1965, Sylvia and her sister Jenny, who was disabled from <a href="/wiki/Polio" title="Polio" class="mw-redirect">polio</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-time2_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-time2-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> were living with their mother in <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> when the elder woman was arrested and jailed for <a href="/wiki/Shoplifting" title="Shoplifting">shoplifting</a>. Lester Likens, who had recently separated from his wife, arranged for his daughters to board with Gertrude Baniszewski, the mother of Paula, a girl with whom the Likens girls had become acquainted. Although Gertrude and her seven children were poor, Lester Likens, as he reported in the trial, "didn't pry" into the condition of the house, and encouraged Baniszewski to "straighten his daughters out".<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> He agreed to pay her twenty dollars a week.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sylvia_Likens&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Abuse and death of Sylvia Likens">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abuse and death of Sylvia Likens</span></h2>
<p>Baniszewski, described by the <i><a href="/wiki/Indianapolis_Star" title="Indianapolis Star" class="mw-redirect">Indianapolis Star</a></i> as a "haggard, underweight <a href="/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthmatic</a>"<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> suffering from depression and the stress of several failed marriages, began taking her anger out on the Likens girls, beating them with <a href="/wiki/Paddle_(spanking)" title="Paddle (spanking)">paddles</a> after payments from their parents failed to arrive on time.</p>
<p>Soon, Baniszewski focused her abuse on Sylvia. Baniszewski accused her of stealing candy she had bought from a grocery store and humiliated her when she admitted that she had once had a boyfriend. She kicked Likens in the genitals and accused her of being <a href="/wiki/Pregnancy" title="Pregnancy">pregnant</a>. Paula Baniszewski, who was in fact pregnant at the time, became enraged and knocked Likens onto the floor. Likens became convinced that she was pregnant, although medical examination proved that she was not and could not have been.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Likens was then falsely accused of spreading rumors through <a href="/wiki/Arsenal_Technical_High_School" title="Arsenal Technical High School">Arsenal Technical High School</a> of Stephanie and Paula being prostitutes. That supposedly prompted Stephanie's boyfriend, Coy Hubbard, to physically attack Likens. Mrs. Baniszewski encouraged Hubbard and other neighborhood children to torment Likens, including, among other things, putting cigarettes out on her skin and forcing her to remove her clothes and insert a <a href="/wiki/Coca-Cola" title="Coca-Cola">Coke</a> bottle into her <a href="/wiki/Vagina" title="Vagina">vagina</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After Likens admitted <a href="/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">stealing</a> a gym suit, without which she was unable to attend gym class, Baniszewski pulled her out of school and did not allow her to leave the house. When Likens urinated in her bed, she was locked in the cellar and forbidden to use the <a href="/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilet</a>. Later, she was forced to consume <a href="/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">feces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Urine" title="Urine">urine</a>. Baniszewski began to carve the words "I'm a prostitute and proud of it!" into Sylvia's stomach with a heated needle, although Richard Hobbs finished the carving when Baniszewski couldn't.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Likens attempted to escape a few days before her death. As punishment, she was tied in the basement and given only crackers to eat. On October 26, 1965, after multiple beatings, she died of <a href="/wiki/Brain_hemorrhage" title="Brain hemorrhage" class="mw-redirect">brain hemorrhage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shock_(medical)" title="Shock (medical)" class="mw-redirect">shock</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As Stephanie Baniszewski and Richard Hobbs realized that Sylvia was not breathing, Stephanie attempted to give Sylvia mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before realizing it was a lost cause.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Baniszewski sent Richard Hobbs to call the police from a nearby <a href="/wiki/Payphone" title="Payphone">payphone</a>. When they arrived, she handed them a letter she had forced Sylvia to write a few days previously, addressed to her parents. This letter stated that she had agreed to have sex with a group of boys in exchange for money, they dragged her away in their car, beat her up, burned her multiple times, and carved the inscription into her skin.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Before the police left, however, Jenny Likens approached them, saying: "Get me out of here and I'll tell you everything."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the highly-publicized trial, Baniszewski denied responsibility for the death, pleading <a href="/wiki/Not_guilty_by_reason_of_insanity" title="Not guilty by reason of insanity" class="mw-redirect">not guilty by reason of insanity</a>. She claimed that she was too distracted by her ill health and <a href="/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression" class="mw-redirect">depression</a> to control her children. Attorneys for the young people on trial (Paula and John Baniszewski, Richard Hobbs, and Coy Hubbard) claimed that they had been pressured by Baniszewski. When Marie Baniszewski, Gertrude's eleven-year-old daughter, was called to the stand as a witness for the defense, she broke down and admitted that she had been forced to heat the needle with which Hobbs carved Sylvia Likens' skin and that she had seen her mother beating and forcing Sylvia into the basement. In his closing statement, Baniszewski's lawyer said: "I condemn her for being a murderess... but I say she's not responsible because she's not all here!" and tapped his head.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On May 19, 1966, Gertrude Baniszewski was convicted of <a href="/wiki/First-degree_murder" title="First-degree murder" class="mw-redirect">first-degree murder</a>, but spared the <a href="/wiki/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty" class="mw-redirect">death penalty</a> and sentenced to life in prison. Her daughter Paula, who had given birth to a daughter named Gertrude during the trial, was convicted of <a href="/wiki/Second-degree_murder" title="Second-degree murder" class="mw-redirect">second-degree murder</a> and also given a life term. Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard, and John Baniszewski were convicted of <a href="/wiki/Manslaughter" title="Manslaughter">manslaughter</a> and sentenced to two-to-21-year terms.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The boys would spend two years in prison. In 1971, Paula and Gertrude Baniszewski were granted another trial. Paula pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was released two years later.<sup id="cite_ref-IndyStar_3-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IndyStar-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Gertrude Baniszewski, however, was again convicted of first-degree murder. She came up for parole in 1985, and despite a public outcry and petitions against her release, the parole board took her good behavior in prison into account, and she was set free.</p>
<p>Gertrude Baniszewski changed her name to Nadine van Fossan and moved to <a href="/wiki/Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>, where she died of <a href="/wiki/Lung_cancer" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> on June 16, 1990.

Damn old Gertrude died. Ha ha ha! I am happy about that." Jenny Likens Wade died of a <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> on June 23, 2004 at the age of 54.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Jonesboro_massacre" title="Jonesboro massacre">Jonesboro school massacre</a>, John Baniszewski, now known as John Blake, gave a statement claiming that young criminals were not beyond help and describing how he had managed to turn his life around.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
