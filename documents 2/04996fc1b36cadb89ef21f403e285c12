<p>Hilbert's problems ranged widely, not only across many areas of pure and applied mathematics, but also in scope and precision. Some of them are propounded precisely enough to admit a clear affirmative/negative answer, like the 3rd problem (probably the easiest for a nonspecialist to understand and also the first to be solved) or the notorious 8th problem (the <a href="/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis" title="Riemann hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>). There are other problems (notably the 5th) for which experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but for which there remain open problems which are so closely related so as to be, perhaps, part of what Hilbert had in mind. Sometimes Hilbert's statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to fit in nicely, e.g. most modern number theorists would probably see the 9th problem as referring to the (conjectural) Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute <a href="/wiki/Galois_group" title="Galois group">Galois group</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Number_field" title="Number field" class="mw-redirect">number field</a>. Still other problems (e.g. the 11th and the 16th) call for work on what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of quadratic forms and real algebraic curves.</p>
<p>There are two problems which are not only unresolved but may in fact be unresolvable by modern standards. The 6th problem calls for the axiomatization of physics, a goal that twentieth century developments in physics (including its recognition as a discipline independent from mathematics) seem to render both more remote and less important than in Hilbert's day. Also the 4th problem concerns the foundations of geometry, in a manner which is now generally judged to be too vague to admit a definitive answer.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the other twenty-one problems have all received significant attention, and late into the twentieth century work on these problems was still considered to be of the highest importance. Notably, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Cohen_(mathematician)" title="Paul Cohen (mathematician)">Paul Cohen</a> received the <a href="/wiki/Fields_Medal" title="Fields Medal">Fields Medal</a> in 1966 for his work on the first problem, and the negative solution of the tenth problem in 1970 by <a href="/wiki/Matiyasevich" title="Matiyasevich" class="mw-redirect">Matiyasevich</a> (completing work of <a href="/wiki/Martin_Davis" title="Martin Davis">Davis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hilary_Putnam" title="Hilary Putnam">Putnam</a> and <a href="/wiki/Julia_Robinson" title="Julia Robinson">Robinson</a>) generated similar excitement and acclaim. Aspects of these problems are still of great interest today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Hilbert%27s_problems&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Ignorabimus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ignorabimus</span></h2>
<p>Several of the Hilbert problems have been resolved (or arguably resolved) in ways that would have been profoundly surprising, and even disturbing, to Hilbert himself. Following <a href="/wiki/Gottlob_Frege" title="Gottlob Frege">Frege</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Russell</a>, Hilbert sought to place mathematics on a sound logical foundation using the method of <a href="/wiki/Formal_system" title="Formal system">formal systems</a>, i.e., <a href="/wiki/Finitism" title="Finitism">finitistic</a> proofs from an agreed upon set of axioms.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> One of the main goals of <a href="/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program" title="Hilbert's program">Hilbert's program</a> was a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic: that is his second problem.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, <a href="/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del" title="Kurt Gödel">Gödel's</a> <a href="/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Second_incompleteness_theorem" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorems">second incompleteness theorem</a> gives a precise sense in which such a finitistic proof of the consistency of arithmetic is provably impossible. Hilbert lived for 12 years after Gödel's theorem, but he does not seem to have written any formal response to Gödel's work.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> But there is no doubt that the significance of Gödel's work to mathematics as a whole (and not just the field of formal logic) was amply and dramatically illustrated by its applicability to one of Hilbert's problems.</p>
<p>Hilbert's tenth problem does not ask whether there exists an algorithm for deciding the solvability of Diophantine equations, but rather asks for the <i>construction</i> of such an algorithm: "to devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers." That the solution to this problem comes by way of showing that there can be no such algorithm would presumably have been very surprising to him.</p>
<p>In discussing his opinions that every mathematical problem should have a solution, Hilbert allows for the possibility that the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Famously, he stated that the point is to know one way or the other what the solution is, and he believed that we always can know this, that in mathematics there is no <a href="/wiki/Ignorabimus" title="Ignorabimus" class="mw-redirect">ignorabimus</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It seems unclear whether he would have regarded the solution of the tenth problem as an instance of ignorabimus: what we are proving not to exist is not the integer solution, but (in a certain sense) our own ability to discern whether a solution exists.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the status of the first and second problems is even more complicated: there is no clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of Gödel (in the case of the second problem), or Gödel and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, a formalization which is quite reasonable but is not necessarily the only possible one.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Hilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided against including one of them in the published list. The "24th problem" (in proof theory, on a criterion for <a href="/wiki/Simplicity" title="Simplicity">simplicity</a> and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert's original manuscript notes by German historian <a href="/w/index.php?title=R%C3%BCdiger_Thiele&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rüdiger Thiele (page does not exist)">Rüdiger Thiele</a> in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Since 1900, other mathematicians and mathematical organizations have announced problem lists, but, with few exceptions, these later problem collections have not had nearly as much influence or generated as much work as Hilbert's problems.</p>
<p>One of the exceptions is furnished by three conjectures made by <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil" title="André Weil">André Weil</a> in the late 1940s (the <a href="/wiki/Weil_conjectures" title="Weil conjectures">Weil conjectures</a>). In the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and the links between the two, the importance of the Weil conjectures was (and is) colossal. The first of the Weil conjectures was proved by <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Dwork" title="Bernard Dwork">Bernard Dwork</a>, and a completely different proof of the first two conjectures via <a href="/wiki/Etale_cohomology" title="Etale cohomology" class="mw-redirect">l-adic cohomology</a> was given by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck" title="Alexander Grothendieck">Alexander Grothendieck</a>. The last and deepest of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proven by <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Deligne" title="Pierre Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a> in what is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematical achievements of all time. Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the <a href="/wiki/Fields_medal" title="Fields medal" class="mw-redirect">Fields medal</a>. However, the Weil conjectures in their scope are more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics. This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having played key roles in the development of many of them.</p>
<p>The turn of the millennium, being also the centennial of Hilbert's announcement of his problems, was a natural occasion to propose "a new set of Hilbert problems." Several mathematicians took up the challenge, notably Fields Medalist <a href="/wiki/Steve_Smale" title="Steve Smale" class="mw-redirect">Steve Smale</a>, who responded to a request of <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Arnold" title="Vladimir Arnold">Vladimir Arnold</a> by proposing a list of 18 problems. <a href="/wiki/Smale%27s_problems" title="Smale's problems">Smale's problems</a> have thus far not received much attention from the media, and it seems unclear how much attention they are getting from the mathematical community.</p>
<p>At least in the mainstream media, the de facto 21st century analogue of Hilbert's problems is the list of seven <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems" title="Millennium Prize Problems">Millennium Prize Problems</a> chosen in 2000 by the <a href="/wiki/Clay_Mathematics_Institute" title="Clay Mathematics Institute">Clay Mathematics Institute</a>. Unlike the Hilbert problems, where the primary award was the admiration of Hilbert in particular and the worldwide mathematical community in general, each prize problem carries a million dollar bounty. As for the Hilbert problems, one of the prize problems (the <a href="/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture" title="Poincaré conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a>) was solved relatively soon after the problems were announced.</p>
<p>Noteworthy for its appearance on the list of Hilbert problems, Smale's list and the list of Millennium Prize Problems — and even, in its geometric guise, in the Weil Conjectures — is the Riemann hypothesis. Notwithstanding some famous (and occasionally loud) recent assaults from leading mathematicians of our day, many experts believe that the Riemann hypothesis will lurk at the top of problem lists for some centuries yet to come. Hilbert himself had this to say: "If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?"</p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="/wiki/DARPA" title="DARPA">DARPA</a> announced its own list of 23 problems which it hopes could lead to major mathematical breakthroughs, "thereby strengthening the scientific and technological capabilities of DoD" <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>. The problems can be found on the <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/download/9bc/9bce380aafb19f9ad3bda188bfc1ab20/DARPA-BAA-08-65.doc" class="external text" title="https://www.fbo.gov/download/9bc/9bce380aafb19f9ad3bda188bfc1ab20/DARPA-BAA-08-65.doc" rel="nofollow">Federal Business Opportunities website</a>.

<p>Of the cleanly-formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus. On the other hand, problems 1, 2, 5, 9, 12, 15, 18<sup>+</sup>, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but where there exists some controversy as to whether it resolves the problem.</p>
<p>The + on 18 denotes that the <a href="/wiki/Kepler_conjecture" title="Kepler conjecture">Kepler conjecture</a> solution is a <a href="/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof" title="Computer-assisted proof">computer-assisted proof</a>, a notion anachronistic for a Hilbert problem and also to some extent controversial because of its lack of verifiability by a human reader in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>That leaves 8 (the <a href="/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis" title="Riemann hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a>) and 12 unresolved, both being in <a href="/wiki/Number_theory" title="Number theory">number theory</a>. On this classification 4, 6, 16, and 23 are too loose to be ever described as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also fall in this class.</p>

It is not difficult to show that the problem has a positive solution within the space of single-valued analytic functions (Raudenbush).

<li id="cite_note-1"><b><a href="#cite_ref-1" title="">^</a></b> A reliable source of Hilbert's axiomatic system, his comments on them and on the foundational "crisis" that was on-going at the time (translated into English), appears as Hilbert's 1927 "The foundations of mathematics". This can be found on p. 464ff in Jean van Heijenoort (editor) 1976/1966, <i>From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1979–1931</i>, Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, ISBN 0-67j4-32449-8(pbk.).</li>
<li id="cite_note-2"><b><a href="#cite_ref-2" title="">^</a></b> See Nagel and Newman revised by Hofstadter 2001:107, footnote #37: "Moreover, although most specialists in mathematical logic do not question the cogency of [Gentzen's] proof, it is not finitistic in the sense of Hilbert's original stipulations for an absolute proof of consistency". Also see next page: "But these proofs [Gentzen's et. al.] cannot be mirrored inside the systems that they concern, and, since they are not finitistic, they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of Hilbert's original program." Hofstadter rewrote the original (1958) footnote slightly, changing the word "students" to "specialists in mathematical logic". And this point is taken up again on page 109 and has not been modified by Hofstadter. (p.108)</li>
<li id="cite_note-3"><b><a href="#cite_ref-3" title="">^</a></b> Reid reports that upon hearing about "Gödel's work from Bernays, he was 'somewhat angry'. . . . At first he was only angry and frustrated, but then he began to try to deal constructively with the problem. . . . It was not yet clear just what influence Gödel's work would ultimately have." (p. 198–199). Reid reports that Hilbert proposed a different form of induction called "'unendliche Induktion.' In 1931 two papers in the new direction appeared." (p. 199)</li>
<li id="cite_note-4"><b><a href="#cite_ref-4" title="">^</a></b> Reid's biography of Hilbert, written in the 1960's from interviews and letters, reports that "Godel (who never had any correspondence with Hilbert) feels that Hilbert's scheme for the foundations of mathematics 'remains highly interesting and important in spite of my negative results' (p. 217). Observe the use of present tense – she reports that Gödel and Bernays among others "answered my questions about Hilbert's work in logic and foundations"(p. vii).</li>
<li id="cite_note-5"><b><a href="#cite_ref-5" title="">^</a></b> This issue that finds its roots in the "foundational crisis" of the early 20th century, in particular the controversy about under what circumstances could the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_Excluded_Middle" title="Law of Excluded Middle" class="mw-redirect">Law of Excluded Middle</a> be employed in proofs. See much more at <a href="/wiki/Brouwer%E2%80%93Hilbert_controversy" title="Brouwer–Hilbert controversy">Brouwer–Hilbert controversy</a>.</li>
<li id="cite_note-6"><b><a href="#cite_ref-6" title="">^</a></b> This famous quote appeared at the end of his presentation of the problems before the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. The entire first part of the address can be found in Reid 1996:74–83. The quote itself can be found on page 81: "This conviction of the solvability of every mathematical problem is a powerful incentive to the worker. We hear within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no <i>ignorabimus.</i>" Reid reports that "the text of the entire talk appears in the <i>Bulletin</i> [<i>Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</i>, vol. 8, 1902, pp. 437–445, 478–479] translated into English by Dr. Mary Winston Newson with the approval of Prof. Hilbert]" (footnote 1 Reid 1996:74).</li>
<li id="cite_note-7"><b><a href="#cite_ref-7" title="">^</a></b> Nagel, Newman and Hofstadter discuss this issue: "The possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for a formal system such as <i>Principia Mathematica</i> is not excluded by Gödel's results. ... His argument does not eliminate the possibility ... But no one today appears to have a clear idea of what a finitistic proof would be like that is <i>not</i> capable of being mirrored inside <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (footnote 39, page 109). The authors conclude that the prospect "is most unlikely."</li>
