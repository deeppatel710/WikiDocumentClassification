For a list of 2008 superdelegates, see <a href="/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_(United_States)_superdelegates,_2008" title="List of Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008">List of Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008</a>.</div>
<p>"<b>Superdelegate</b>" is an informal term commonly used for some of the <a href="/wiki/Delegate" title="Delegate">delegates</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention" title="Democratic National Convention">Democratic National Convention</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention" title="United States presidential nominating convention">presidential nominating convention</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">United States Democratic Party</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike most convention delegates, the superdelegates are not selected based on the <a href="/wiki/Political_party" title="Political party">party</a> <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" title="Primary election">primaries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caucus" title="Caucus">caucuses</a> in each <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a>, in which voters choose among candidates for the party's <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">presidential</a> <a href="/wiki/Nomination" title="Nomination">nomination</a>. Instead, most of the superdelegates are seated automatically, based solely on their status as current or former party leaders and elected officials ("PLEOs"). Others are chosen during the primary season. All the superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the nomination.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party rules do not use the term "superdelegate". This article follows the most common media practice in using the term "superdelegate" to refer to unpledged delegates, who fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>delegates seated based on other positions they hold, who are formally described (in Rule 9.A) as "unpledged party leader and elected official delegates"<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> (unpledged PLEO delegates); and</li>
<li>additional unpledged delegates selected by each state party (in a fixed predetermined number), who are formally described (in Rule 9.B) as "unpledged add-on delegates" and who need not hold any party or elected position before their selection as delegates.<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Unpledged PLEO delegates should not be confused with pledged PLEOs. Under Rule 9.C, the pledged PLEO slots are allocated to candidates based on the results of the primaries and caucuses.<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Another difference between pledged PLEOs and unpledged PLEOs is that there is a fixed number of pledged PLEO slots for each state, while the number of unpledged PLEOs can change during the campaign. Pledged PLEO delegates are not generally considered superdelegates.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> also seats some party officials as delegates without regard to primary or caucus results (see <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2008#Delegate_selection" title="Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008">Republican delegate selection</a>), but the term "superdelegate" is most commonly applied only in the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/2008_Democratic_National_Convention" title="2008 Democratic National Convention">2008 Democratic National Convention</a> the superdelegates made up approximately one-fifth of the total number of delegates. The closeness of the race between the leading contenders, <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, led to speculation that the superdelegates would play a decisive role in selecting the nominee, a prospect that caused unease among some Democratic Party leaders.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Obama, however, won a majority of the pledged delegates<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and of the superdelegates, and won the Democratic presidential nomination.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Democratic Party rules distinguish pledged and unpledged delegates. Pledged delegates are selected based on their announced preferences in the contest for the presidential nomination. In the <a href="/wiki/Political_party" title="Political party">party</a> <a href="/wiki/Primary_election" title="Primary election">primary elections</a> and <a href="/wiki/Caucus" title="Caucus">caucuses</a> in each U.S. state, voters express their preference among the contenders for the party’s nomination for <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. Pledged delegates supporting each candidate are chosen in approximate ratio to their candidate’s share of the vote. They fall into three categories: district-level pledged delegates (usually by <a href="/wiki/Congressional_district" title="Congressional district">congressional districts</a>)<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>; at-large pledged delegates; and pledged PLEO delegates. In a minority of the states, delegates are legally required to support the candidate to whom they are pledged.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition to the states' requirements, the party rules state (Rule 12.J): "Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them."<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, the unpledged PLEO delegates (Rule 9.A) are seated without regard to their presidential preferences, solely by virtue of being current or former elected officeholders and party officials. Many of them have chosen to announce endorsements, but they are not bound in any way. They may support any candidate they wish, including one who has dropped out of the presidential race.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The other superdelegates, the unpledged add-on delegates (Rule 9.B), who need not be PLEOs, are selected by the state parties after some of the pledged delegates are chosen,<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> but they resemble the unpledged PLEO delegates in being free to vote as they wish.</p>
<p>The process of selecting Democratic Party delegates is described <a href="http://www.demconvention.com/how-to-become-a-delegate/" class="external text" title="http://www.demconvention.com/how-to-become-a-delegate/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.democrats.org/page/-/dem_convention/rules.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Superdelegate&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention" title="1968 Democratic National Convention">1968 Democratic National Convention</a>, the Democratic Party made changes in its delegate selection process, based on the work of the <a href="/wiki/McGovern-Fraser_Commission" title="McGovern-Fraser Commission">McGovern-Fraser Commission</a>. The purpose of the changes was to make the composition of the convention less subject to control by party leaders and more responsive to the votes cast during the campaign for the nomination.</p>
<p>Some Democrats believed that these changes had unduly diminished the role of party leaders and elected officials, weakening the Democratic tickets of <a href="/wiki/George_McGovern" title="George McGovern">George McGovern</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>. The party appointed a commission chaired by <a href="/wiki/Jim_Hunt" title="Jim Hunt">Jim Hunt</a>, the then-<a href="/wiki/State_governor" title="State governor" class="mw-redirect">Governor</a> of <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, to address this issue. In 1982, the Hunt Commission recommended and the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> adopted a rule that set aside some delegate slots for Democratic members of Congress and for state party chairs and vice chairs.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Under the original Hunt plan, superdelegates were 30% of all delegates, but when it was finally implemented for the 1984 election, they were 14%. The number has steadily increased, and today they are approximately 20%.<sup id="cite_ref-cqweekly_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cqweekly-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1984 only state party chairs and vice chairs were guaranteed superdelegate status. The remaining spots were divided two ways. The Democrats in Congress were allowed to select up to 60% of their members to fill some of these spots. The remaining positions were left to the state parties to fill with priority given to governors and big-city mayors. In 1988 this process was simplified. Democrats in Congress were now allowed to select up to 80% of their members. All Democratic National Committee members and all Democratic governors were given superdelegate status. This year also saw the addition of the <i>distinguished party leader</i> category (although former DNC chairs were not added to this category until 1996, and former House and Senate minority leaders were not added until 2000). 1992 saw the addition of a category of unpledged "add-ons", a fixed number of spots allocated to the states, intended for other party leaders and elected officials not already covered by the previous categories. Finally beginning in 1996 all Democratic members of Congress were given superdelegate status.<sup id="cite_ref-TerryMichael_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TerryMichael-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1984" title="United States presidential election, 1984">1984 election</a>, the major contenders for the Presidential nomination were <a href="/wiki/Gary_Hart" title="Gary Hart">Gary Hart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Mondale" title="Walter Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>. Each won some primaries and caucuses. Mondale was only slightly ahead of Hart in the total number of votes cast, but won the support of almost all superdelegates and became the nominee.<sup id="cite_ref-Berman_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Berman-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The superdelegates have not always prevailed, however. In the Democratic primary phase of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2004" title="United States presidential election, 2004">2004 election</a>, <a href="/wiki/Howard_Dean" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a> acquired an early lead in delegate counts by obtaining the support of a number of superdelegates before even the first primaries were held.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Nevertheless, <a href="/wiki/John_Kerry" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> defeated Dean in a succession of primaries and caucuses and won the nomination.</p>
<p>In 1988, a study found that superdelegates and delegates selected through the primary and caucus process are not substantively different in terms of viewpoints on issues from each other. But it also found that superdelegates are more likely to prefer candidates with Washington experience than outsider candidates.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle" style="font-style:italic; padding-left:2em;">Main article: <a href="/wiki/List_of_Democratic_Party_(United_States)_superdelegates,_2008" title="List of Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008">List of Democratic Party (United States) superdelegates, 2008</a></div>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/2008_Democratic_National_Convention" title="2008 Democratic National Convention">2008 Democratic National Convention</a>, superdelegates will cast approximately 823.5 votes, with fractions arising because superdelegates from <a href="/wiki/Michigan" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Democrats_Abroad" title="Democrats Abroad">Democrats Abroad</a> are entitled to half a vote each. Of the superdelegates' votes, 745 are from unpledged PLEO delegates and 78.5 are from unpledged add-on delegates, although the exact number in each category is subject to events.</p>
<p>There is no fixed number of unpledged PLEO delegates. The number can change during the campaign as particular individuals gain or lose qualification under a particular category. The unpledged PLEO delegates are: all Democratic members of the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a>, Democratic <a href="/wiki/Governor#United_States" title="Governor">governors</a>, members of the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee" title="Democratic National Committee">Democratic National Committee</a>, "[a]ll former Democratic Presidents, all former Democratic Vice Presidents, all former Democratic Leaders of the U.S. Senate, all former Democratic Speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives and Democratic Minority Leaders, as applicable, and all former Chairs of the Democratic National Committee." There is an exception, however, for otherwise qualified individuals who endorse another party’s candidate for President; under Rule 9.A, they lose their superdelegate status.<sup id="cite_ref-Dem_rules_0-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dem_rules-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> (In 2008, Senator <a href="/wiki/Joe_Lieberman" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> of <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> endorsed Republican <a href="/wiki/John_McCain" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>, which, according to the chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, resulted in his disqualification as a superdelegate.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Lieberman's status had, however, previously been questioned because, although he is a registered Democratic voter and caucuses with the Democrats, he won re-election as the candidate of the <a href="/wiki/Connecticut_for_Lieberman" title="Connecticut for Lieberman">Connecticut for Lieberman</a> Party and is listed as an "Independent Democrat".<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The count for Connecticut's delegates in the state party's delegate selection plan, issued before his endorsement of McCain, appears to exclude Lieberman,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> and he was not included on at least one list of PLEO delegates prepared before his endorsement.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>)</p>
<p>The unpledged add-on delegate slots for the various states total 81, but the initial rule had been that the five unpledged add-on delegates from Michigan and Florida would not be seated, leaving 76 unpledged add-on delegates.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Michigan and Florida were being penalized for violating Democratic Party rules by holding their primaries too early.</p>
<p>As of February 13, 2008 one analysis found that the 2008 Democratic National Convention would have 794 superdelegates.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The exact number has changed several times because of events. For example, the number decreased as a result of the death of Representative <a href="/wiki/Tom_Lantos" title="Tom Lantos">Tom Lantos</a>, the move from Maine to Florida of former Maine Governor <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Curtis" title="Kenneth Curtis" class="mw-redirect">Kenneth Curtis</a><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>, and the resignation of <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> Governor <a href="/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer" title="Eliot Spitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a>. (Because New York's new Governor, <a href="/wiki/David_Paterson" title="David Paterson">David Paterson</a>, is an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee, he was already a superdelegate before becoming Governor.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup>) On the other hand, the number increased when special elections for the House of Representative were won by Democrats <a href="/wiki/Bill_Foster_(Illinois_politician)" title="Bill Foster (Illinois politician)">Bill Foster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Carson" title="André Carson">André Carson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Speier" title="Jackie Speier">Jackie Speier</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Travis_Childers" title="Travis Childers">Travis Childers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The biggest change came on May 31 as a result of the meeting of the national party's Rules and Bylaws Committee, which lessened the penalty initially imposed on Michigan and Florida. The party had excluded all delegates (including superdelegates) from either state.
