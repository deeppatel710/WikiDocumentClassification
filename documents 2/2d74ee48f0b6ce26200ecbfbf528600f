<p>Franklin organized a group of friends to provide a structured forum for discussion. The group, initially composed of twelve members, called itself the Junto (the word is a mistaken use of the masculine singular Spanish adjective "joined", mistaken for the feminine singular noun "junta", "a meeting". Both derive from Latin "iunct-", past participle of "iungere", "to join"). The members of the Junto were drawn from diverse occupations and backgrounds, but they all shared a spirit of inquiry and a desire to improve themselves, their community, and to help others. Among the original members were <a href="/wiki/Printer_(publisher)" title="Printer (publisher)">printers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Surveyor" title="Surveyor">surveyors</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cabinetmaker" title="Cabinetmaker" class="mw-redirect">cabinetmaker</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cobbler" title="Cobbler">cobbler</a>, a clerk, and a merchant. Although most of the members were older than Franklin, he was clearly their leader.</p>
<p>At just 21 years of age, he oversaw five men, including Hugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb, who were soon to form the core of the Junto. Franklin was an outgoing, social individual and had become acquainted with some of the businessmen at a club called the Every Night Club. This gathering included prominent merchants who met informally to drink and discuss the business of the day. Franklin’s congenial ways attracted many unique and learned individuals, and from these, he selected the members for the Junto.</p>
<p>All members lived in Philadelphia and came from diverse areas of interest and business. Along with Meredith, Potts and Webb, they included Joseph Breintnall, merchant and <a href="/wiki/Scrivener" title="Scrivener">scrivener</a>, who also loved poetry and natural history. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Godfrey_(inventor)" title="Thomas Godfrey (inventor)">Thomas Godfrey</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Glazier" title="Glazier">glazier</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and inventor, and Nicholas Scull and <a href="/wiki/William_Parsons" title="William Parsons">William Parsons</a> were both surveyors. Scull was also a <a href="/wiki/Bibliophile" title="Bibliophile" class="mw-redirect">bibliophile</a> and Parsons a cobbler and <a href="/wiki/Astrology" title="Astrology">astrologer</a>. William Maugridge was a cabinetmaker, <a href="/wiki/William_Coleman_(judge)" title="William Coleman (judge)">William Coleman</a> a merchant’s clerk, and Robert Grace a gentleman. Grace’s wealth meant he did not have to work, but apparently he brought an intellectual element to the group, plus a fine library. The twelfth member of the Junto remained a mystery until 2007, when Professor George Boudreau of Penn State discovered a long-forgotten account of the club's refreshments, and verified that shoemaker John Jones, Jr. was an original member. Jones was a Philadelphia Quaker, a neighbor of Franklin's, and later a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Library_Company_of_Philadelphia" title="Library Company of Philadelphia">Library Company of Philadelphia</a>. The club met Friday nights, first in a tavern and later in a house, to discuss moral, political and scientific topics of the day.</p>
<p>Franklin describes the formation and purpose of the Junto in his <a href="/wiki/The_Autobiography_of_Benjamin_Franklin" title="The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin">autobiography</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Junto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: The Questions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Questions</span></h2>
<p>The Junto's Friday evening meetings were organized around a series of questions that Franklin devised, covering a range of intellectual, personal, business, and community topics. These questions were used as a springboard for discussion and community action. In fact, through the Junto, Franklin promoted such concepts as volunteer fire-fighting clubs, improved security (night watchmen), and a public hospital.</p>
<p>This is the list of questions Franklin devised to guide the discussions at Junto meetings (from Franklin's papers, dated 1728, and included in some editions of his autobiography):</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you met with any thing in the author you last read, remarkable, or suitable to be communicated to the Junto? particularly in <a href="/wiki/History" title="History">history</a>, <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poetry" title="Poetry">poetry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a>, travels, mechanic arts, or other parts of knowledge?</li>
<li>What new story have you lately heard agreeable for telling in conversation?</li>
<li>Hath any citizen in your knowledge failed in his business lately, and what have you heard of the cause?</li>
<li>Have you lately heard of any citizen’s thriving well, and by what means?</li>
<li>Have you lately heard how any present rich man, here or elsewhere, got his estate?</li>
<li>Do you know of any fellow citizen, who has lately done a worthy action, deserving praise and imitation? or who has committed an error proper for us to be warned against and avoid?</li>
<li>What unhappy effects of intemperance have you lately observed or heard? of imprudence? of passion? or of any other vice or folly?</li>
<li>What happy effects of <a href="/wiki/Temperance_(virtue)" title="Temperance (virtue)">temperance</a>? of prudence? of moderation? or of any other virtue?</li>
<li>Have you or any of your acquaintance been lately sick or wounded? If so, what remedies were used, and what were their effects?</li>
<li>Who do you know that are shortly going [on] voyages or journeys, if one should have occasion to send by them?</li>
<li>Do you think of any thing at present, in which the Junto may be serviceable to mankind? to their country, to their friends, or to themselves?</li>
<li>Hath any deserving stranger arrived in town since last meeting, that you heard of? and what have you heard or observed of his character or merits? and whether think you, it lies in the power of the Junto to oblige him, or encourage him as he deserves?</li>
<li>Do you know of any deserving young beginner lately set up, whom it lies in the power of the Junto any way to encourage?</li>
<li>Have you lately observed any defect in the laws, of which it would be proper to move the legislature an amendment? Or do you know of any beneficial law that is wanting?</li>
<li>Have you lately observed any encroachment on the just liberties of the people?</li>
<li>Hath any body attacked your reputation lately? and what can the Junto do towards securing it?</li>
<li>Is there any man whose friendship you want, and which the Junto, or any of them, can procure for you?</li>
<li>Have you lately heard any member’s character attacked, and how have you defended it?</li>
<li>Hath any man injured you, from whom it is in the power of the Junto to procure redress?</li>
<li>In what manner can the Junto, or any of them, assist you in any of your honourable designs?</li>
<li>Have you any weighty affair in hand, in which you think the advice of the Junto may be of service?</li>
<li>What benefits have you lately received from any man not present?</li>
<li>Is there any difficulty in matters of opinion, of justice, and injustice, which you would gladly have discussed at this time?</li>
<li>Do you see any thing amiss in the present customs or proceedings of the Junto, which might be amended?</li>
</ol>
<p>Any person to be qualified as a member was to stand up, lay his hand upon his breast, and be asked the following questions, viz.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you any particular disrespect to any present members? <i>Answer.</i> I have not.</li>
<li>Do you sincerely declare that you love mankind in general, of what profession or religion soever? <i>Answer.</i> I do.</li>
<li>Do you think any person ought to be harmed in his body, name, or goods, for mere speculative opinions, or his external way of worship? <i>Answer.</i> No.</li>
<li>Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavor impartially to find and receive it yourself, and communicate it to others? <i>Answer.</i> Yes.</li>
</ol>
