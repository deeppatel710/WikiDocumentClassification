			<p><b>Conversations with God</b> (CwG) is a sequence of nine books written by <a href="/wiki/Neale_Donald_Walsch" title="Neale Donald Walsch">Neale Donald Walsch</a>, written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> answers.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The first book of the Conversations with God series, <i>Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue</i>, appeared on bookshelves in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, and quickly became a publishing phenomenon, staying on the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a></i> Best-Sellers List for 137 weeks. The succeeding volumes in the trilogy also appeared prominently on the List.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="/wiki/Larry_King" title="Larry King">Larry King</a>, Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working. After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down. The ensuing dialogue became the <i>Conversations with God</i> books. However, in the interview with King, Walsch freely admitted that he couldn’t be sure that it was God speaking and that the books could have been the product of his own subconscious, but he stated that he truly believed it to be the voice of God speaking to him.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Containing nearly 3000 pages of material in total, the series presents a vast number of ideas. The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.</p>
<p><a name="CwG.27s_basic_messages" id="CwG.27s_basic_messages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Conversations_with_God&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: CwG's basic messages">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CwG's basic messages</span></h3>
<p>In <i>Friendship with God</i> (page 373), God allegedly presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are all One.</li>
<li>There's Enough.</li>
<li>There's Nothing We Have to Do.</li>
<li>Ours Is Not A Better Way, Ours Is Merely Another Way.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wiki/Existence" title="Existence">Existence</a> is essentially <a href="/wiki/Nondual" title="Nondual" class="mw-redirect">nondual</a> in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God. The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us. The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of <a href="/wiki/Humanity" title="Humanity">humanity</a>. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we <i>have</i> to do, there are an <i>infinite</i> number of ways to experience this, not just the <i>one</i> way we may have chosen so far.</p>
<p>According to the books, God recommends many <a href="/wiki/Economy" title="Economy">economic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social" title="Social">social</a> changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world and recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also teach that reincarnation and life on other planets exists.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Conversations_with_God&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: God's motive for creation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">God's motive for creation</span></h3>
<p>In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that "knowing" and "experiencing" oneself are different things. Before creation there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in <a href="/wiki/Myriad" title="Myriad">myriad</a> ways because everything is one.</p>
<p>This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that <a href="/wiki/Sentience" title="Sentience">sentience</a> can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just "know" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. In Walsch's view we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either <a href="/wiki/Functional" title="Functional">functional</a> or <a href="/wiki/Dysfunctional" title="Dysfunctional" class="mw-redirect">dysfunctional</a>. These rememberings take place over "time" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.</p>

<p>The voice of God states in Book 1 that words are not the truth, and thus readers must ultimately take what is being said and consult their own <a href="/wiki/Feeling" title="Feeling">feelings</a> to determine if they are in agreement with it. The voice says this is true of any other book or words we come across. Though the books bear the title <i>Conversations with God</i> and the author introduces the first book by stating he is "taking dictation" from God, the voice of God in the <a href="/wiki/Trilogy" title="Trilogy">trilogy</a> explains that the dialogue is God speaking to everyone all the time. The question is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with you in the next song you hear, the next breeze that caresses your ear, the next conversation you overhear. "All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me."</p>
<p>At the deepest level consciousness is and that there is only one "voice" regardless whether it is thought to belong to God, or an individual, or imagination. This leads to a statement of the <a href="/wiki/Divinity" title="Divinity">Divine</a> <a href="/wiki/Dichotomy" title="Dichotomy">Dichotomy</a>: that two contradictory <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truths</a> can exist, neither making the other untrue. This is possible only in the realm of the relative, because, as was stated above, in the absolute all things are one thing, and there is nothing else.</p>

<p>In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and "God" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([Hinduism]/' '<a href="/wiki/Bhagavad-Gita" title="Bhagavad-Gita" class="mw-redirect">Bhagavad-Gita</a><i>/<a href="/wiki/Sikhism" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>).</i></li>
<li>Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect (<a href="/wiki/Rousseau" title="Rousseau" class="mw-redirect">Rousseau</a>).</li>
<li>We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know (<a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a>).</li>
<li>Physical reality is an illusion (<a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>/ Sikhism/<a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>'s concept of <i><a href="/wiki/Maya_(illusion)" title="Maya (illusion)">maya</a></i>).</li>
<li>One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (<a href="/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching" title="Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>).</li>
<li>God is everything. (<a href="/wiki/Hinduism" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> / <a href="/wiki/Spinoza" title="Spinoza" class="mw-redirect">Spinoza</a> / <a href="/wiki/Brahman" title="Brahman">Brahman</a>)</li>
<li>God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself.

<p>The CwG books sometimes make hints and suggestions about future events. An example of this is The <a href="/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton" title="Impeachment of Bill Clinton">Impeachment of Bill Clinton</a> in book 2 of the trilogy. This account was first published in May of <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, "God" told Walsch in Chapter 19 (p.226) that because the President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> was "courageously fighting big money's vested interest" there were going to be "tremendous powers attempting to remove him from office." Less than a year later, in 1998, the <a href="/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal" title="Lewinsky scandal">Lewinsky scandal</a> broke and resulted in calls for Clinton's <a href="/wiki/Impeachment" title="Impeachment">impeachment</a> and possible eviction from his position. Eventually President Clinton was officially impeached, although the resulting vote to convict and remove him from office then failed to win sufficient votes.</p>
<p>In one of the books "God" states that the universe had a beginning and will have an end (as part of the 'breathing in and out of God')<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. The latter part of this statement appears to have been disproved by the discovery of <a href="/wiki/Dark_Energy" title="Dark Energy" class="mw-redirect">Dark Energy</a>.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the CwG books do not really claim to make predictions.</p>
