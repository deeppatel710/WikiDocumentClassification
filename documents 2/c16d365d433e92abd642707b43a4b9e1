<p>The <b>Hatfield-McCoy feud</b> (<a href="/wiki/1878" title="1878">1878</a> – <a href="/wiki/1891" title="1891">1891</a>) is an account of American <a href="/wiki/Lore" title="Lore">lore</a> that has become a metaphor for bitterly <a href="/wiki/Feud" title="Feud">feuding</a> rival parties in general. It involved two warring families of the <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>-<a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> backcountry along the <a href="/wiki/Tug_Fork_River" title="Tug Fork River" class="mw-redirect">Tug Fork River</a>, off the <a href="/wiki/Big_Sandy_River_(Kentucky-West_Virginia)" title="Big Sandy River (Kentucky-West Virginia)" class="mw-redirect">Big Sandy River</a>. The Hatfields involved in the feud descended from Ephraim (born c. 1765), and the McCoys from William (born c. 1750). Partial family trees for both clans are shown at the end of this article.</p>

<p>The McCoys, led by <a href="/wiki/Randolph_McCoy" title="Randolph McCoy">Randolph "Ole Ran’l" McCoy</a> (grandson of William), lived mostly on the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> side of <a href="/wiki/Tug_Fork" title="Tug Fork">Tug Fork</a> (a tributary of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Sandy_River" title="Big Sandy River">Big Sandy River</a>), and the Hatfields, led by <a href="/wiki/Devil_Anse_Hatfield" title="Devil Anse Hatfield">William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield</a> (great-grandson of Ephraim), lived mostly on the <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a> side. Both families were part of the first wave of pioneers to settle the Tug Valley. The majority of the Hatfields living in Mingo County (in what would eventually become West Virginia), fought for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a> in the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. The majority of the McCoys living in Pike County Kentucky fought for the Union army. The first real violence in the feud was the murder of a returning <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union</a> soldier, Asa Harman McCoy. Harman was killed by a group of ex-Confederate Homeguard called the "Logan Wildcats". Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first but later confirmed to have been at home, sick at the time of the murder.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Hatfields were more affluent than the McCoys and were well-connected politically. "Devil Anse" Hatfield's <a href="/wiki/Logging" title="Logging">timbering</a> operation was a source of wealth for his family, but he employed many non-Hatfields, and even hired Albert McCoy, Lorenzo Dow McCoy, and Selkirk McCoy.</p>

<p>"Most people believe that the Hatfield-McCoy feud began with the death of Asa Harman McCoy (Randall McCoy's brother) on January 7, 1863." The uncle of Devil Anse, Jim Vance, and his "Logan Wildcats" despised Asa Harmon McCoy because he had joined the <a href="/wiki/Union_army" title="Union army" class="mw-redirect">Union army</a> during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Harman had been discharged from the army early because of a broken leg; several nights after he returned home, he was murdered in a nearby cave.</p>
<p>The second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred after an 1878 dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield had it and Randolph McCoy said it was his.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The pig was only in the fight because some of the Hatfields believed that since the pig was on their land, that meant it was theirs; some of the McCoys objected saying the "notches" or "marks' on the pigs ears were McCoy marks, and not Hatfield marks. The matter was taken to the local Justice of the Peace, and the McCoys lost because of the testimony of Bill Staton, a relative of both families. The individual presiding over the case was <a href="http://www.ghat.com/hatfah01.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ghat.com/hatfah01.htm" rel="nofollow">Anderson "Preacher Anse" Hatfield</a>. In June 1880, Staton Hatfield was killed by two McCoy brothers, Sam and Paris, who were later acquitted on the grounds of <a href="/wiki/Right_of_self-defense" title="Right of self-defense">self-defense</a>.</p>

<p>The feud escalated after Roseanna McCoy began an affair with Johnse Hatfield (Devil Anse's son), leaving her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse Hatfield was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky bootlegging warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Devil Anse Hatfield, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported to the county seat, Pikeville Kentucky for justice the next day.</p>
<p>Despite what was seen as a betrayal of her family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna, marrying instead her cousin Nancy McCoy in <a href="/wiki/1881" title="1881">1881</a>.</p>
<p>The escalation continued in <a href="/wiki/1882" title="1882">1882</a> when Ellison Hatfield, brother of "Devil Anse" Hatfield, was killed by three of Roseanna McCoy's young brothers: Tolbert, Pharmer, and Bud. Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a shot during an election day fight that took place in Kentucky. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield constables and were being taken to Pikeville for trial. Devil Anse Hatfield organized a large group of followers and cut off the constables with McCoy prisoners in toll before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia to await the fate of mortally wounded Ellison Hatfield. When Ellison finnally died from his injuries the McCoy brothers were themselves murdered in turn as the <a href="/wiki/Vendetta" title="Vendetta" class="mw-redirect">vendetta</a> escalated. They were tied to <a href="/wiki/Pawpaw" title="Pawpaw">pawpaw</a> bushes, where each was shot numerous times. Their bodies were described as "bullet-riddled".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since January 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The escalation reach its peak during the 1888 New Years Night Massacre. Several of the Hatfield gang surrounded the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family. The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randal McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break but two of his children were murdered and his wife was beaten and left for dead. The remaining McCoy family moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.</p>
<p>Between <a href="/wiki/1880" title="1880">1880</a> and <a href="/wiki/1891" title="1891">1891</a>, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country, and compelling the governors of both Kentucky and West Virginia to call up their state militias to restore order<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> The Governer of West Virginia once even threatened to have his militia invade Kentucky. Kentucky Governer <a href="/wiki/Simon_Bolivar_Buckner,_Sr." title="Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.">S.B. Buckner</a> in response sent his Adjutant General to Pike County to investigate the situation. Newspapers from around the country awaited word from Adjutant General Sam Hill to find out "what in the Sam Hill was going on up there".</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/1888" title="1888">1888</a>, Wall Hatfield and eight others were arrested by a posse led by Frank Phillips, and brought to Kentucky to stand trial for the murder of Alifair McCoy who was killed during the New Years Massacre.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> She had been shot after exiting the burning house.

<p>The families finally agreed to stop the fighting in 1891. The trial of Johnse Hatfield was the last of the feud trials. It took place in 1901.</p>
<p>In 1979, the two families united for a special week's taping of the popular game show <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Feud" title="Family Feud">Family Feud</a></i>, in which they played for a cash prize and a <a href="/wiki/Pig" title="Pig">pig</a> which was kept on stage during the games.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Many tourists each year travel to parts of West Virginia and Kentucky to see the areas and historic relics which remain from the days of the feud. In 2004 a large project known as the "Hatfield and McCoy historic site restoration" was completed. This project was funded by a federal grant from the SBA. Many improvements to various feud sites were completed. A committee of local historians spent months researching reams of information to find the factual history of the events surrounding the feud. This research was compiled in a audio CD called the "Hatfield - McCoy Feud Driving Tour". The CD is a self guided driving tour of the restored feud sites. It includes maps and pictures as well as the audio CD. (see external link below)</p>
<p>Bo McCoy, a college student, organized a joint reunion of the Hatfield and McCoy gangs in 2000 which attained national attention; more than 5000 persons attended the reunion dubbed "The Reunion of the Millennium".<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Additionally, an entire recreation area, the 500 mile (800&#160;km) <a href="/wiki/Hatfield-McCoy_Trails" title="Hatfield-McCoy Trails">Hatfield-McCoy Trails</a> system, has been created around the theme of the Hatfield-McCoy Feud.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
