<p><b>Warren Steed Jeffs</b> (born December 3, 1955) was the president of the <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalist_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints" title="Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints">Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a> (FLDS Church) from 2002 to 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> While president and "Prophet, Seer and Revelator" of the organization, Jeffs wielded considerable religious as well as secular power, in line with the FLDS Church's theocratic principles.</p>
<p>Jeffs gained international notoriety in May 2006 when he was placed on the <a href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI" class="mw-redirect">FBI</a>'s <a href="/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives" title="FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives">Ten Most Wanted List</a> for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution on <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a> state charges related to his alleged arrangement of extralegal marriages between his adult male followers and underage girls. He was arrested in August 2006 in <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and agreed to be taken to Utah for trial. In May and July 2007 the State of <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> charged him with eight additional counts—including sexual conduct with minors and incest—in two separate cases.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> His trial, which began early in September 2007 in <a href="/wiki/St._George,_Utah" title="St. George, Utah">St. George, Utah</a>, lasted less than a month, and on September 25 the verdict was read declaring him guilty of two counts of rape as an accomplice.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> On November 20, 2007 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years to <a href="/wiki/Life_imprisonment" title="Life imprisonment">life</a> and has begun serving his sentence at the <a href="/wiki/Utah_State_Prison" title="Utah State Prison">Utah State Prison</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Deseret112207_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Deseret112207-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Warren_Jeffs&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>Jeffs is the son of <a href="/wiki/Rulon_Jeffs" title="Rulon Jeffs">Rulon Jeffs</a>. His father, the leader of the FLDS Church at his death, was survived by 19 or 20 wives and has about 60 children.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> No information is available about Warren Jeffs on their website.</p>
<p>Warren Jeffs' official title in the FLDS Church was "President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator". He also held the title of "President of the Priesthood," which meant that he was the head of the organization of all adult male church members that were deemed worthy to hold the church's priesthood. Jeffs was a counselor to his father Rulon Jeffs when the elder Jeffs held these leadership positions; upon the death of Rulon Jeffs in 2002, Warren Jeffs succeeded him and became FLDS Church leader.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of Jeffs' statements after his father's death was directed at high-ranking officials in the FLDS Church: "I won't say much, but I will say this—hands off my father's wives." Addressing the recent widows, he said, "You women will live as if Father is still alive and in the next room." Within a week, Warren had married all but two of his father's several dozen wives.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> This act had the obvious political expediency of helping solidify his own power within the often-fractious community, while also insuring a measure of security for the widows who might otherwise be without means of support. After this, Jeffs continued to marry more women, many of whom were close relatives. Because of his claimed descent from <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ" class="mw-redirect">Jesus Christ</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Smith" title="Joseph Smith" class="mw-redirect">Joseph Smith</a>, Jeffs has taught that his marriages are necessary to preserve sacred bloodlines, although from a sociological perspective much of the explanation may lie simply in the numerically small population base from which wives may be drawn.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Jeffs, the sole individual in the church who possessed the authority to perform its marriages, was responsible for assigning wives to husbands. Jeffs also held the authority to discipline wayward male believers by "reassigning their wives, children and homes to another man."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the FLDS Church owns essentially all of the homes and real estate in the areas where its members reside. This phenomenon is not dissimilar from the case with other religious denominations in the areas in which they predominate, but appears proportionally exaggerated in the case of the FLDS due to its relatively small scope. The FLDS also appears to exercise substantial if not complete control over the children born into the congregation. Children are often subjected to incidents that are currently considered torture in the Geneva Convention. Male subjects are reported to have been frequently exiled from the church due to their alleged competition with the elder male members of the church for the limited number of suitable marriage candidates.</p>
<p>In 2000, the <a href="/wiki/Colorado_City_Unified_School_District" title="Colorado City Unified School District">Colorado City Unified School District</a> had more than 1200 students enrolled. When the FLDS Church decided to remove its members' children from public schools, enrollment decreased to around 250. Jeffs, however, did not require the FLDS members who made up the majority of the school district's administrators to quit their positions.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Until courts in Utah intervened, Jeffs controlled almost all of the land in <a href="/wiki/Colorado_City,_Arizona" title="Colorado City, Arizona">Colorado City, Arizona</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hildale,_Utah" title="Hildale, Utah">Hildale, Utah</a>, which was part of a church trust, the United Effort Plan (UEP). The land has been estimated to be worth over $100 million. Currently, all UEP assets are in the custody of the Utah court system pending further litigation.</p>
<p>In January 2004, Jeffs expelled a group of 20 men from Colorado City, including the mayor, and reassigned their wives and children to other men in the community. Jeffs, like his predecessors, continued the standard FLDS and Mormon fundamentalist tenet that faithful men must follow what is known as the doctrine of "Celestial Marriage" or plural marriage in order to attain the highest degree of Exaltation in the afterlife. Jeffs specifically taught that a devoted church member is expected to have at least three wives in order to get into heaven, and the more wives a man has, the closer he is to heaven.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Former church members claim that Jeffs himself has seventy wives (Egan, 2005).</p>
<p>Before his 2006 arrest, Jeffs had last been seen on January 1, 2005, near <a href="/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas" title="Eldorado, Texas">Eldorado, Texas</a>, at the dedication ceremony of the foundation of a large and elaborate new FLDS temple on an area of land called the <a href="/wiki/YFZ_Ranch" title="YFZ Ranch">YFZ Ranch</a>. The ranch, which Jeffs' church reportedly planned to designate as its new home base,<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> came into the public eye when Texas authorities took legal custody of 416 children on April 7, 2008 when a 16-year-old girl reportedly phoned to report abuse. The girl in the report claimed to have said that she was married to a 50-year-old man and had given birth to his child at age 15. However, residents told authorities that there was in fact no such girl; the calls were ultimately traced to a woman totally unconnected to the FLDS, <a href="/wiki/Rozita_Swinton" title="Rozita Swinton" class="mw-redirect">Rozita Swinton</a>, and known for repeated instances of filing false reports. Nevertheless, Texas authorities continued to investigate whether it was a hoax. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The children and women who were suspected of being minors were returned after Texas courts established that the state had not presented sufficient evidence of abuse to have removed all of the women and children</p>
<p>On June 10, 2006, Arizona <a href="/wiki/Attorney_General" title="Attorney General" class="mw-redirect">Attorney General</a> <a href="/wiki/Terry_Goddard" title="Terry Goddard">Terry Goddard</a> told the <i><a href="/wiki/Deseret_Morning_News" title="Deseret Morning News" class="mw-redirect">Deseret Morning News</a></i> that he had heard from several sources that Jeffs had returned to Arizona, and had performed marriage ceremonies in a mobile home that was being used as a wedding chapel.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On March 27, 2007, the <i><a href="/wiki/Deseret_Morning_News" title="Deseret Morning News" class="mw-redirect">Deseret Morning News</a></i> reported that Jeffs had renounced his role as prophet of the FLDS Church in a conversation with his brother Nephi. Nephi quoted him as saying he was "the greatest of all sinners" and that God never called him to be Prophet. This statement was reportedly given to his brother Nephi and Jeffs and his defense team had no comment on it. Rumours suggest it was a lie from his brother Nephi, trying to assume his brother's role, while more rumours circulated saying he must step down as prophet so a new man may perform marriages and continue adding wives to the men of the community. An unnamed source said that he retracted this statement.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> However the veracity of that source was called into question when Jeffs presented a handwritten note to the judge at the end of trial on March 27 saying that he was not a prophet of the FLDS Church.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On November 7, 2007, the Washington County Attorney's Office released video of jailhouse conversations between Nephi and Warren Jeffs. In the videos Warren renounces his prophethood, claiming that God had told him that if he revealed that he was not the rightful prophet, and was a "wicked man", he would still gain a place in the <a href="/wiki/Telestial_kingdom" title="Telestial kingdom" class="mw-redirect">telestial kingdom</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-dnvideoshows_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dnvideoshows-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Jeffs also admits to what he calls, "immoral actions with a sister and a daughter" when he was 20 years old.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Other records show that while incarcerated, Jeffs tried to commit suicide by banging his head against the walls and trying to hang himself.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Jeffs resigned as president of the FLDS Church effective November 20, 2007. In an email to the <i>Deseret Morning News</i>, Jeffs' attorneys made the following statements: "Mr. Jeffs has asked that the following statement be released to the media and to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints," ... "Mr. Jeffs resigned as President of the Corporation of the President of The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Inc." The statement does not address his ecclesiastical position as prophet of the FLDS Church, and many in the FLDS communities still regard him as the prophet and their current leader."<sup id="cite_ref-Perkins_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Perkins-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In July 2004, Warren Jeffs' nephew, Brent Jeffs, filed a lawsuit against him alleging that in the late 1980s his uncle <a href="/wiki/Sodomy" title="Sodomy">sodomized</a> him in the Salt Lake Valley compound then owned by the FLDS Church. Brent Jeffs said he was five or six years old at the time, and that Warren Jeffs' brothers, also named in the lawsuit, watched and participated in the abuse. Two of Warren Jeffs' other nephews also made similar abuse claims against him. One of the alleged victims, Clayne Jeffs, committed <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> with a firearm after accusing Warren Jeffs of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_assault" title="Sexual assault">sexually assaulting</a> him as a child.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In June 2005, Jeffs was charged with sexual assault on a minor and with conspiracy to commit sexual misconduct with a minor for allegedly arranging, in 2002, a marriage between a 14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old first cousin. The girl, known as "Jane Doe IV" testified that she begged "Uncle Rulon" to let her wait until she was older, or choose another man for her. Rulon Jeffs was apparently "sympathetic", but Warren Jeffs was not, and she was forced to go through with the marriage. The 14-year-old alleged that her new husband <a href="/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">raped</a> her repeatedly. She eventually left her husband and is now married to Lamont Barlow.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Jeffs faced the above charges in <a href="/wiki/Mohave_County,_Arizona" title="Mohave County, Arizona">Mohave County, Arizona</a>. In July 2005, the Arizona Attorney General's office distributed wanted posters offering $10,000 for information leading to Jeffs' arrest and conviction.</p>
<p>In late 2005, Jeffs was put on the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a>'s most wanted fugitive list, offering $60,000 for information leading to his arrest.

<p>Around this time, Warren Jeffs' brother, Seth, was arrested under suspicion of harboring a fugitive.
