<p>David Reimer was born as a male identical twin in <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba" class="mw-redirect">Winnipeg, Manitoba</a>. His birth name was Bruce; his twin brother was named Brian. At the age of 6 months, after concern was raised about how both twins urinated, both boys were diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Phimosis" title="Phimosis">phimosis</a>. They were referred for circumcision at the age of 8 months. On April 27, 1966, doctors performed the circumcision using an unconventional method in which skin would be burned. The procedure did not go as doctors had planned, and David Reimer's penis was burned beyond surgical repair.<sup id="cite_ref-CBCnews_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CBCnews-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Reimer's parents, concerned about his prospects for future happiness and sexual function without a penis, took him to <a href="/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital" title="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Johns Hopkins Medical Center</a> in Baltimore to see <a href="/wiki/John_Money" title="John Money">John Money</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychologist</a> who was developing a reputation as a pioneer in the field of sexual development and <a href="/wiki/Gender_identity" title="Gender identity">gender identity</a>, based on his work with <a href="/wiki/Intersexuality" title="Intersexuality">intersex</a> patients. Money was a prominent proponent of the theory that <a href="/wiki/Gender_identity" title="Gender identity">gender identity</a> developed primarily as a result of <a href="/wiki/Observational_learning" title="Observational learning">social learning</a> from early childhood and could be changed with the appropriate behavioral interventions. The Reimers had seen Money being interviewed on the Canadian news program <i><a href="/wiki/This_Hour_Has_Seven_Days" title="This Hour Has Seven Days">This Hour Has Seven Days</a></i>, where he discussed his theories about gender. He, and other physicians working with young children born with abnormal genitalia, believed that a penis could not be replaced but that a functional <a href="/wiki/Vagina" title="Vagina">vagina</a> could be constructed surgically, and that Reimer would be more likely to achieve successful, functional sexual maturation as a girl than as a boy.<sup id="cite_ref-Colapinto_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Colapinto-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>They persuaded his parents that sex reassignment would be in Reimer's best interest, and, at the age of 22 months, surgery was performed to remove his <a href="/wiki/Testicle" title="Testicle">testes</a>. He was <a href="/wiki/Sex_assignment" title="Sex assignment">reassigned</a> to be <a href="/wiki/Gender_of_rearing" title="Gender of rearing">raised</a> as a female and given the name 'Brenda'. Psychological support for the reassignment and surgery was provided by John Money, who continued to see Reimer for years, both for treatment and to assess the outcome. This reassignment was considered an especially valid test case of the social learning concept of gender identity for two reasons. First, Reimer had a twin brother, Brian Reimer, who made an ideal control since the two not only shared genes and family environments, but they had shared the intrauterine environment as well. Second, this was reputed to be the first reassignment and reconstruction performed on a male infant who had no abnormality of prenatal or early postnatal <a href="/wiki/Sexual_differentiation" title="Sexual differentiation">sexual differentiation</a>.</p>
<p>For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case", describing apparently successful female gender development, and using this case to support the feasibility of sex reassignment and surgical reconstruction even in non-intersex cases. Money wrote: "The child's behavior is so clearly that of an active little girl and so different from the boyish ways of her twin brother." <a href="/wiki/Estrogen" title="Estrogen">Estrogen</a> was given to Reimer when he reached adolescence to induce breast development. However, Reimer had experienced the visits to Baltimore as traumatic rather than therapeutic, and when Dr. Money started pressuring the family to bring him in for surgery during which a vagina would be created, the family discontinued the follow-up visits. John Money published nothing further about the case to suggest that the reassignment had not been successful.</p>
<p>Reimer's later account, written two decades later with <a href="/wiki/John_Colapinto" title="John Colapinto">John Colapinto</a>, described how, contrary to Money's reports, when living as Brenda, Reimer did not identify as a girl. He was ostracized and bullied by peers, and neither frilly dresses nor female hormones made him feel female. By the age of 15, Reimer was experiencing suicidal depression, and told his parents he would commit suicide if they made him see John Money again. In 1980, Reimer's parents told him the truth about his gender reassignment, following advice from Reimer's <a href="/wiki/Endocrinologist" title="Endocrinologist" class="mw-redirect">endocrinologist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a>. At 14, Reimer decided to assume a male gender identity, calling himself David. Reimer's brother, Brian, began to experience a pattern of mental disturbance and later developed <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> after learning of his brother's transition.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since January 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> By 1997, Reimer had undergone treatment to reverse the reassignment, including testosterone injections, a double <a href="/wiki/Mastectomy" title="Mastectomy">mastectomy</a>, and two <a href="/wiki/Phalloplasty" title="Phalloplasty">phalloplasty</a> operations. He also married a woman and became a stepfather to her 3 children.</p>
<p>His case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to Milton Diamond, an academic <a href="/wiki/Sexology" title="Sexology">sexologist</a> who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly. Soon after, Reimer went public with his story and John Colapinto published a widely disseminated and influential account in <i><a href="/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine in December 1997.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> They went on to elaborate the story in a book, <i>As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Colapinto_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Colapinto-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=David_Reimer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Colapinto split the revenues from the book with Reimer, giving him financial security but not freedom from his problems. In addition to his life-long difficult relationship with his parents, Reimer had to deal with the death of his brother from an overdose of <a href="/wiki/Antidepressant" title="Antidepressant">antidepressants</a> in 2002, unemployment and separation from his wife Jane. On May 2, 2004, she told him she wished to temporarily separate; Reimer stormed out of the house and did not return. Two days later Jane Reimer received a call from the police that they had located her husband but he did not want his location revealed. Two hours later, they called again, informing her of his suicide. Reimer had returned home while she was out and retrieved a shotgun, sawing off its barrel before leaving. On the morning of May 5, he drove to the nearby parking lot of a grocery store, parked his car and fatally shot himself in the head.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=David_Reimer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Social effect of David Reimer's story">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social effect of David Reimer's story</span></h2>
<p>The report and subsequent book about Reimer influenced several medical practices and reputations, and even current understanding of the <a href="/wiki/Biology_of_gender" title="Biology of gender">biology of gender</a>. The case accelerated the decline of sex reassignment and surgery for unambiguous <a href="/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system" title="XY sex-determination system">XY</a> male infants with <a href="/wiki/Micropenis" title="Micropenis">micropenis</a>, various other rare congenital malformations, and penile loss in infancy.</p>
<p>It supported the arguments of those who feel that prenatal and early-infantile <a href="/wiki/Hormone" title="Hormone">hormones</a> have a strong influence on brain differentiation, gender identity and perhaps other <a href="/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism">sex-dimorphic</a> behavior. The applicability of this case to appropriate <a href="/wiki/Sex_assignment" title="Sex assignment">sex assignment</a> in cases of intersex conditions involving severe deficiency of <a href="/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> or <a href="/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome" title="Androgen insensitivity syndrome">insensitivity</a> to its effects is more uncertain. For some people, the inability to predict gender identity or preference in this case confirmed skepticism about doctors' abilities to do so in general, or about the wisdom of using <a href="/wiki/Genital_reconstructive_surgery" title="Genital reconstructive surgery">genital reconstructive surgery</a> to commit an infant with an intersex condition or genital defect to a specific <a href="/wiki/Gender_role" title="Gender role">gender role</a> before the child is old enough to claim a gender identity. The Intersex Society of North America, who opposes involuntary sex-reassignment, treats the story of David Peter Reimer as a cautionary tale about why one should not needlessly modify the genitals of unconsenting minors.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Among the repercussions was damage to John Money's reputation. Not only had his theory of gender plasticity been dealt a severe blow, but Colapinto's book described bizarrely unpleasant childhood therapy sessions, and implied that Money had ignored or concealed the developing evidence that Reimer's reassignment to female was not going well. Money's defenders have suggested that some of the allegations about the therapy sessions may have been the result of <a href="/wiki/False_memory_syndrome" title="False memory syndrome">False memory syndrome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GUnews_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GUnews-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> However, David's brother and mother both agreed that the therapy was not "working" in the sense that Reimer wasn't in any way developing a female self-image.<sup id="cite_ref-CBCnews_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CBCnews-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Dr. Money never publicly stated that his conclusions were incorrect.</p>
<p>The reputation of Johns Hopkins Medical Center as an institution at the forefront of progressive care for people with intersex and <a href="/wiki/Transgender" title="Transgender">transgender</a> conditions was hurt as well. Despite the uniqueness of this case, many people cited it as evidence that physicians should not attempt to surgically treat the problems created by birth defects of the genitalia.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
