<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Emergency_telephone_number&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Emergency numbers and mobile telephones">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Emergency numbers and mobile telephones</span></h2>
<p>Mobile phones can be used in countries with different emergency numbers. A traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers, however. The mobile phone and the <a href="/wiki/SIM_card" title="SIM card" class="mw-redirect">SIM card</a> have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM phone, the special emergency call setup takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency calls even when the phone keyboard is locked, the phone is without a <a href="/wiki/SIM_card" title="SIM card" class="mw-redirect">SIM card</a>, or an emergency number is entered instead of the <a href="/wiki/Personal_identification_number" title="Personal identification number">PIN</a>.</p>
<p>Most GSM mobile phones have <b>112</b> and <b>911</b> as pre-programmed emergency numbers that are always available.<sup id="cite_ref-IETF_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IETF-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The SIM card issued by the operator can contain additional country-specific emergency numbers that can be used even when roaming abroad. The GSM network can also update the list of well-known emergency numbers when the phone registers to it.</p>
<p>Using an emergency number recognized by a GSM phone like <i>112</i> instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone dialing an emergency service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam onto another network, leading to trouble if there is no access to the home network. Dialing a known emergency number like <i>112</i> forces the phone to make the call possible on any network.</p>
<p>On some networks a GSM phone without a SIM card may be used to make emergency calls and most GSM phones accept a larger list of emergency numbers without SIM card, such as <i>112</i>, <i>911</i> <i>118</i>, <i>119</i>, <i>000</i>, <i>110</i>, <i>08</i>, and <i>999</i>. However, some GSM networks will not accept emergency calls from phones without a SIM card, or even require a SIM card that has credit. For example, Latin American GSM networks and those in the United Kingdom typically do not allow emergency calls without a SIM. Also, GSM phones sold in some countries like Singapore do not accept <i>112</i> as an emergency number if they have a SIM card inserted.</p>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission" title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</a> requires networks to route every mobile-phone and payphone 911 call to an emergency service call center, including phones that have never had service, or whose service has lapsed.<sup id="cite_ref-FCC_wireless_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FCC_wireless-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FCC_payphone_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FCC_payphone-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result, there are programs that provide donated used mobile phones to victims of domestic violence and others especially likely to need emergency services.</p>
<p>Mobile phones generate additional problems for emergency operators, as many phones will allow emergency numbers to be dialed even while the keypad is locked. Since mobile phones are typically carried in pockets and small bags, the keys can easily be depressed accidentally, leading to unintended calls. A system has been developed in the UK which connects calls where the caller is silent to an automated system, leaving more operators free to handle genuine emergency calls.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Emergency_telephone_number&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Configuration and operation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Configuration and operation</span></h2>
<p>The emergency telephone number is a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the emergency telephone number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though with the advent of electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an emergency telephone number, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.</p>
<p>An emergency telephone number call may be answered by either a <a href="/wiki/Telephone_operator" title="Telephone operator">telephone operator</a> or an <a href="/wiki/Emergency_service_dispatcher" title="Emergency service dispatcher" class="mw-redirect">emergency service dispatcher</a>. The nature of the emergency (<a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medical" title="Medical" class="mw-redirect">medical</a>) is then determined. If the call has been answered by a telephone operator, they then connect the call to the appropriate emergency service, who then dispatches the appropriate help. In the case of multiple services being needed on a call, the most urgent need must be determined, with other services being called in as needed.</p>
<p>Emergency dispatchers are trained to control the call in order to provide help in an appropriate manner. The emergency dispatcher may find it necessary to give urgent advice in life-threatening situations. Some dispatchers have special training in telling people how to perform <a href="/wiki/First_aid" title="First aid">first aid</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation" title="Cardiopulmonary resuscitation">CPR</a>.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, an emergency service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. This is normally done using the system that the telephone company uses to bill calls, making the number visible even for users who have unlisted numbers or who block <a href="/wiki/Caller_ID" title="Caller ID">caller ID</a>. For an individual fixed landline telephone, the caller's number can often be associated with the caller's address and therefore their location. However, with mobile phones and business telephones, the address may be a mailing address rather than the caller's location. The latest "enhanced" systems, such as <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_911" title="Enhanced 911">Enhanced 911</a>, are able to provide the physical location of mobile telephones. This is often specifically mandated in a country's legislation.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Emergency_telephone_number&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: History of emergency services numbers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of emergency services numbers</span></h2>
<p>When an emergency happened in the pre-dial (or "manual") telephone era, the user simply picked up the telephone receiver and waited for the operator to answer "number, please?" The user responded with "get me the police," "get me the fire service," or "I need an ambulance/doctor." Even in a large city it was seldom necessary to ask for these services by number.</p>
<p>In small towns, operators frequently went the extra mile by knowing where to reach doctors, vets, and law enforcement personnel at all times. Frequently, the operator was also responsible for activating the town's fire alarm.</p>
<p>When manual switching systems began to be replaced by automatic, or "dial" systems, there was frequently concern among users that the very personalized emergency service provided by manual operators would be lost.</p>
<p>This problem was at least partially solved in the USA, Canada, and the UK by dialing "0" for the local assistance operator in case of emergency, although faster service could be obtained if the user dialed the full number for the Police or Fire Department. This system remained essentially unchanged throughout most of North America until the 1970s.</p>
<p>The first emergency number system to be deployed was in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> on June 30, 1937. When <b><a href="/wiki/9-9-9" title="9-9-9" class="mw-redirect">999</a></b> was dialed, a buzzer sounded and a red light flashed in the exchange to attract an operator's attention. It was gradually extended to cover the entire country, but it was not until the late 1970s that the facility was available from every telephone.</p>
<p>In the days of <a href="/wiki/Loop_disconnect_dialing" title="Loop disconnect dialing" class="mw-redirect">loop disconnect dialing</a>, attention was devoted to making the numbers difficult to dial accidentally by making them involve long sequences of pulses, such as with the UK <b>999</b> emergency number. This contrasts to modern times, where repeated sequences of numbers are easily dialed on <a href="/wiki/Mobile_phone" title="Mobile phone">mobile phones</a>, particularly as mobile phones will dial an emergency number while the keypad is locked or even without a <a href="/wiki/SIM" title="SIM" class="mw-redirect">SIM</a> card. Some people in the UK have reported accidentally dialing 112 by loop-disconnect while working on extension telephone wiring, and point to this as a disadvantage of that number.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The first North American emergency number was the 911 system deployed in <a href="/wiki/Winnipeg,_Manitoba" title="Winnipeg, Manitoba" class="mw-redirect">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manitoba" title="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1959 at the urging of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Juba" title="Stephen Juba">Stephen Juba</a>, mayor of Winnipeg at the time. The first US 911 emergency phone system came nine years later and was set up in <a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> in 1968, but it was not in use everywhere until the 1980s to standardize the number across most of the <a href="/wiki/NANP" title="NANP" class="mw-redirect">NANP</a>.</p>
<p>The implementation of 911 service in the USA was a gradual and haphazard process. The chief obstacle was the fact that telephone service boundaries seldom, if ever, coincided exactly with governmental and other jurisdictional boundaries. In other words, a user might dial 911, only to discover that he had been connected to the wrong dispatch center because he had telephone service from one location, but lived within the boundaries of another jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a great deal of electromechanical switching equipment was still in use, and much of it was difficult if not impossible to adapt to recognize 911, especially in small towns and rural areas where the call might have to be switched over a considerable distance. For this reason, it is still not unusual for a County Sheriff's Department to have an "800" (long distance, toll-free) number.</p>
<p>Gradually, various problems were overcome; "smart" or "enhanced" 911 systems were developed that not only displayed the caller's number and address at the dispatch center, but also could be configured so that 911 calls were automatically routed to the correct dispatch center, regardless of which central office the caller was served from.</p>
<p>The rapid replacement of electromechanical switching systems in the 1980s with electronic or digital systems eliminated the problem of older switches that would not recognize 911. At this point, 911 service is available in most of North America, but there is still the occasional small, remote town that does not have it.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, in 1928, telephone operators had to connect the calls for emergency reasons even when the phone service was closed. In 1929, an automatic connection system was set up, initially for fewer than 10,000 people in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, allowing them to dial <b>18</b> to reach the fire brigade. The service was not widespread until the 1970s.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/European_Conference_of_Postal_and_Telecommunications_Administrations" title="European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations">CEPT</a> recommended the use of <b>112</b> in 1972. The <a href="/wiki/European_Union" title="European Union">European Union</a> subsequently adopted the <b>112</b> number as a standard on 29 July, 1991. It is now a valid emergency number throughout EU countries and in many other CEPT countries. It works in parallel with other local emergency numbers in about 2/3 of EU states.</p>
<p>In January 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" title="Internet Engineering Task Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> released a set of <a href="/wiki/Request_for_Comments" title="Request for Comments" class="mw-redirect">RFC documents</a> pertaining to emergency calls in <a href="/wiki/Internet_Protocol" title="Internet Protocol">IP</a> networks.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
