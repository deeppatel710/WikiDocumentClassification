<p>Ken was born in <a href="/wiki/Bori,_Nigeria" title="Bori, Nigeria">Bori</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Niger_Delta" title="Niger Delta">Niger Delta</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-born_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-born-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> He spent his childhood in an <a href="/wiki/Anglican_church" title="Anglican church" class="mw-redirect">Anglican</a> home and eventually proved himself to be an excellent student, and obtained a scholarship to study <a href="/wiki/English_literature" title="English literature">English</a> at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Government_College_Umuahia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Government College Umuahia (page does not exist)">Government College Umuahia</a>. He completed his studies at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Ibadan" title="University of Ibadan">University of Ibadan</a> and briefly became a teaching assistant at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Lagos" title="University of Lagos">University of Lagos</a>.</p>
<p>However, he soon took up a government post as the Civilian Administrator for the port city of <a href="/wiki/Bonny" title="Bonny">Bonny</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Niger_Delta" title="Niger Delta">Niger Delta</a>, and during the <a href="/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War" title="Nigerian Civil War">Nigerian Civil War</a> was a strong supporter of the federal cause against the <a href="/wiki/Biafra" title="Biafra">Biafrans</a>. His best known novel, <i>Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English</i>, tells the story of a naive village boy recruited to the army during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, and intimates the corruption and patronage in Nigeria's military regime of the time. His war diaries, <i>On a Darkling Plain</i>, document Saro-Wiwa's experience during the war. Saro-Wiwa was also a successful businessman and television producer. His satirical television series, <i>Basi &amp; Co.</i>, is purported to have been the most watched soap opera in <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s Saro-Wiwa served as the Regional Commissioner for Education in the Rivers State Cabinet, but was dismissed in 1973 because of his support for Ogoni autonomy. In the late 1970s, he established a number of successful business ventures in retail and real-estate, and during the 1980s concentrated primarily on his writing, journalism and television production. His intellectual work was interrupted in 1987 when he re-entered the political scene, appointed by the newly-installed dictator <a href="/wiki/Ibrahim_Babangida" title="Ibrahim Babangida">Ibrahim Babangida</a> to aid the country's transition to democracy. But Ken soon resigned because he felt Babangida's supposed plans for a return to democracy were disingenuous. Ken's sentiments were proven correct in the coming years, as Babangida failed to relinquish power. In 1993, he annulled Nigeria's general elections which would transfer power to a civilian government, sparking mass civil unrest and eventually forcing him to step-down, at least officially, in the same year.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Ken_Saro-Wiwa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Activism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Activism</span></h2>
<p>In 1990, Saro-Wiwa began devoting most of his time to human rights and environmental causes, particularly in Ogoniland. He was one of the earliest members of the <a href="/wiki/Movement_for_the_Survival_of_the_Ogoni_People" title="Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People">Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People</a> (MOSOP), which advocated for the rights of the Ogoni people. The Ogoni Bill of Rights, written by MOSOP, set out the movement's demands, including increased autonomy for the Ogoni people, a fair share of the proceeds of oil extraction, and remediation of environmental damage to Ogoni lands. In 1992, Saro-Wiwa was imprisoned for several months, without trial, by the Nigerian military government.</p>
<p>Ken was Vice President of Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization <a href="/w/index.php?title=(UNPO)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="(UNPO) (page does not exist)">(UNPO)</a> General Assembly from 1993 - 1995. <a href="/wiki/UNPO" title="UNPO" class="mw-redirect">UNPO</a> is an international, nonviolent, and democratic organisation (of which <a href="/wiki/MOSOP" title="MOSOP" class="mw-redirect">MOSOP</a> is a member). Its members are indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognised or occupied territories who have joined together to protect and promote their human and cultural rights, to preserve their environments and to find nonviolent solutions to conflicts which affect them.</p>
<p>In January 1993, MOSOP organized peaceful marches of around 300,000 Ogoni people – more than half of the Ogoni population – through four Ogoni centers, drawing international attention to his people's plight. The same year the Nigerian government occupied the region militarily.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Ken_Saro-Wiwa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Arrest and execution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Arrest and execution</span></h2>
<p>Saro-Wiwa was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993, but was released after a month. In May 1994, he was arrested and accused of incitement to murder, following the deaths of four Ogoni elders. Saro-Wiwa denied the charges, but was imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal. Nearly all of the defendants' lawyers resigned in protest to the trial's cynical rigging by the <a href="/wiki/Sani_Abacha" title="Sani Abacha">Abacha regime</a>. The resignations left the defendants to their own means against the tribunal, which continued to bring witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa and his peers. Many of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been <a href="/wiki/Bribe" title="Bribe" class="mw-redirect">bribed</a> by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. The trial was widely criticised by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Human_rights_organisation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Human rights organisation (page does not exist)">human rights organisations</a>, and half a year later, Ken Saro-Wiwa received the <a href="/wiki/Right_Livelihood_Award" title="Right Livelihood Award">Right Livelihood Award</a> for his courage as well as the <a href="/wiki/Goldman_Environmental_Prize" title="Goldman Environmental Prize">Goldman Environmental Prize</a>.</p>
<p>Very few observers were surprised when the tribunal declared a "guilty" verdict, but most were shocked that the penalty would be death by hanging for all nine defendants. Many were skeptical that the executions would actually occur, as the Nigerian government would face international outrage and possible sanctions and other legal action should the penalties be carried out. But on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1995-11-10"><a href="/wiki/November_10" title="November 10">10 November</a> <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a></span>, Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders (the "<a href="/wiki/Ogoni_Nine" title="Ogoni Nine">Ogoni Nine</a>") were <a href="/wiki/Execution_(legal)" title="Execution (legal)" class="mw-redirect">executed</a> by <a href="/wiki/Hanging" title="Hanging">hanging</a> at the hands of military personnel. According to most accounts, Ken was the last person to be hanged and so was forced to watch the death of his colleagues. Information on the circumstances of Saro-Wiwa's own death are unclear, but it is generally agreed that multiple attempts were required before Saro-Wiwa died.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since August 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, which was meeting in <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> at the time. The <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions on Nigeria because of such actions.</p>
<p>A memorial to Saro-Wiwa was unveiled in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2006-11-10"><a href="/wiki/November_10" title="November 10">10 November</a> <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It consists of a sculpture in the form of a bus, and was created by <a href="/wiki/Sokari_Douglas_Camp" title="Sokari Douglas Camp">Sokari Douglas Camp</a>, also from Nigeria.

<p>A biography, <i>In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son's Journey to Understanding His Father's Legacy</i>, was written by his son, journalist <a href="/wiki/Ken_Wiwa" title="Ken Wiwa">Ken Wiwa</a>. Published in September 2005, shortly before the tenth anniversary of Saro-Wiwa's execution, Canadian author <a href="/wiki/J._Timothy_Hunt" title="J. Timothy Hunt">J. Timothy Hunt</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Politics_of_Bones" title="The Politics of Bones">The Politics of Bones</a></i> documented the flight of Ken's brother <a href="/wiki/Owens_Wiwa" title="Owens Wiwa">Owens Wiwa</a>, after his brother's execution and his own imminent arrest, to London and then on to Canada, where he is now a citizen and continues his brother's fight on behalf of the Ogoni people. Moreover, it is also the story of Owens' personal battle against the Nigerian government to locate his brother's remains after they were buried in an unmarked mass-grave. Ken Saro-Wiwa's own diary, <i>A Month and a Day: A Detention Diary</i> was published in January 1995, 2 months after his execution. A book of essays about Wiwa entitled <i>Before I Am Hanged: Ken Saro-Wiwa, Literature, Politics, and Dissent</i> was published by Africa World Press in December 1999. More information on the struggles of the Ogoni people can be found in the book <i>Ogoni's Agonies: Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Crisis in Nigeria</i> (<a href="/wiki/Special:BookSources/0865436479" class="internal">ISBN 0-86543-647-9</a>)</p>
