<p>Aldo Leopold was born in <a href="/wiki/Burlington,_Iowa" title="Burlington, Iowa">Burlington</a>, <a href="/wiki/Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>. He grew up in contact with the outdoors. During his youth, Leopold's family spent summers in Michigan's <a href="/wiki/Les_Cheneaux_Islands" title="Les Cheneaux Islands">Les Cheneaux Islands</a>, where today exists an Aldo Leopold Preserve on Marquette Island commemorating his love for the outdoors. Leopold attended the prestigious <a href="/wiki/Lawrenceville_School" title="Lawrenceville School">Lawrenceville School</a> in Lawrenceville, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, after which he moved on to the <a href="/wiki/Yale_University_School_of_Forestry" title="Yale University School of Forestry" class="mw-redirect">Yale University School of Forestry</a>. He received his Master's degree in Forestry in 1909. Leopold developed an appreciation for nature in terms of ecology, beauty and mystery, as well as a resource. Thereafter, his professional life encompassed forestry, ecology and writing.</p>
<p>Leopold served for 18 years in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" title="United States Forest Service">United States Forest Service</a>, working in the <a href="/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">American Southwest</a> (New Mexico and Arizona) until he was transferred in 1924 to the Forest Products Lab in <a href="/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin" title="Madison, Wisconsin">Madison</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. In 1928 he left the Forest Service and started doing independent contract work. He mostly did wildlife and game surveys throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>In 1933 he was appointed Professor of Game Management in the Agricultural Economics Department at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. He lived in a modest two-story home close to the campus with his wife and children, and he taught at the university until his death. Today, his home is an official landmark of the city of Madison and is occupied by Elizabeth Loniello. One of his sons, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Leopold" title="Luna Leopold">Luna</a>, went on to become a noted <a href="/wiki/Hydrology" title="Hydrology">hydrologist</a> and geology professor at UC Berkeley. Another son, <a href="/wiki/A._Starker_Leopold" title="A. Starker Leopold">A. Starker Leopold</a>, was a noted wildlife biologist and also a professor at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>An advocate for the preservation of wildlife and wilderness areas, Leopold became a founder of <a href="/wiki/The_Wilderness_Society_(United_States)" title="The Wilderness Society (United States)">The Wilderness Society</a> in 1935. Named in his honor, the <a href="/wiki/Aldo_Leopold_Wilderness" title="Aldo Leopold Wilderness">Aldo Leopold Wilderness</a> lies within the boundaries of the <a href="/wiki/Gila_National_Forest" title="Gila National Forest">Gila National Forest</a>, in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Leopold was instrumental in the proposal for Gila to be managed as a <a href="/wiki/Wilderness_area" title="Wilderness area" class="mw-redirect">wilderness area</a>. As a result, in 1924, Gila National Forest became the first designated wilderness area by the US government. Together, the Leopold Wilderness and Gila National Forest, often are considered the starting point for the modern wilderness-conservation movement throughout the United States.</p>
<p>His <a href="/wiki/Nature_Writing" title="Nature Writing" class="mw-redirect">nature writing</a> is notable for its simple directness. His portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved, or had known for many years, displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature. Leopold offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) out of a sense of a culture or society's sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from "mechanization" now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there. However, he also writes "Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer's chains, but whether it really does is debatable." (p. 262)</p>

<p>Leopold's book <i><a href="/wiki/A_Sand_County_Almanac" title="A Sand County Almanac">A Sand County Almanac</a></i> has been read by millions and has informed and changed the <a href="/wiki/Environmental_movement" title="Environmental movement">environmental movement</a> and a widespread interest in <a href="/wiki/Ecology" title="Ecology">ecology</a> as a science. By the same token, the Wilderness Society and Leopold’s work in it were important precursors to the environmental movement that coalesced around the time of the first <a href="/wiki/Earth_Day" title="Earth Day">Earth Day</a>.</p>
<p>Published in 1949, shortly after Leopold's death, <i>A Sand County Almanac</i> is a combination of natural history, scene painting with words, and philosophy. It is perhaps best known for the following quote, which defines his <a href="/wiki/Land_ethic" title="Land ethic">land ethic</a>: "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the <a href="/wiki/Biotic_community" title="Biotic community" class="mw-redirect">biotic community</a>. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." The concept of a <a href="/wiki/Trophic_cascade" title="Trophic cascade">trophic cascade</a> is put forth in the chapter Thinking Like a Mountain, wherein Leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem..<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Aldo_Leopold&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Conservation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Conservation</span></h2>
<p>In "The <a href="/wiki/A_Land_Ethic" title="A Land Ethic" class="mw-redirect">Land Ethic</a>", a chapter of <i><a href="/wiki/A_Sand_County_Almanac" title="A Sand County Almanac">A Sand County Almanac</a></i>, Leopold delves into conservation in "The Ecological Conscience" section. He wrote: "Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land." Leopold felt it was generally agreed that more <a href="/wiki/Conservation_ethic" title="Conservation ethic" class="mw-redirect">conservation</a> <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> was needed; however quantity and content were up for debate.</p>
<p>As it seemed to Leopold, curriculum-content guidelines current at the time he was writing (late 1940s) boiled down to: "obey the law, vote right, join some organizations and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land; the government will do the rest." He was critical of this "formula." To him, it appeared to serve self-interest but it did not address <a href="/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical</a> questions.</p>
<p>This fact brought him to the conclusion that obligations have no meaning without conscience, and the problem we face is the extension of the social conscience from people to land. At the time he was writing, he believed that, without benefit of philosophy and religion, conservation had been minimized.</p>
<p>With the hopes of addressing ethical issues as well as educational challenges, Leopold put forward an example in the issue of <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>'s southwestern <a href="/wiki/Topsoil" title="Topsoil">topsoil</a> slipping seaward. In 1933 the public offered assistance to farmers who adopted remedial practices for five years, which was widely accepted. Once the five-year period was completed, the farmers only continued practices that offered economic gain for themselves, disregarding practices which were profitable for the community. In response, the <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin_Legislature" title="Wisconsin Legislature">Wisconsin Legislature</a> passed the Soil Conservation District Law in 1937 that allowed farmers to write rules for land use themselves. Even with the additional incentives of free technical service and the availability of specialized machinery for loan, rules that would benefit the community continued to be ignored as no rules were written. A small amount of progress did occur, but not enough to address the pertinent problems.</p>
