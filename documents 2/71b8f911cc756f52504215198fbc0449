<p><b>Club 33</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Private_club" title="Private club" class="mw-redirect">private club</a> located in the heart of the <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans_Square" title="New Orleans Square">New Orleans Square</a> section of <a href="/wiki/Disneyland" title="Disneyland">Disneyland</a>. Officially maintained as a secret feature of the theme park, the entrance of the club is located next to the <a href="/wiki/Blue_Bayou_Restaurant" title="Blue Bayou Restaurant">Blue Bayou Restaurant</a> at "33 Royal Street" with the entrance recognizable by an ornate address plate with the number 33 engraved on it. When riding <a href="/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(theme_park_ride)" title="Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, just as the ride departs, the Blue Bayou restaurant is visible, but the balconies above it are actually a part of Club 33.</p>
<p>Club 33 members and their guests have exclusive access to the club's restaurant, and the premises are not open to the public at large. It is the only location within Disneyland to offer <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a>, though Disneyland has a park-wide <a href="/wiki/Liquor_license" title="Liquor license">liquor license</a> and has set up bars throughout the park for private events. Club 33's wine list includes vintages priced at $200. In addition to beer and wine, Club 33 has a full bar, though patrons may not order directly from the bar and must place orders through their server.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Club_33&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Origin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origin</span></h2>
<p>When Walt Disney was working with various corporate promoters for his attractions at the 1964–1965 <a href="/wiki/1964_New_York_World%27s_Fair" title="1964 New York World's Fair">New York World's Fair</a>, he noted the various "<a href="/wiki/Very_Important_Person" title="Very Important Person">VIP</a> Lounges" provided as an accommodation for the corporate elite. This gave him the idea that culminated in Club 33. When New Orleans Square was planned, this special area for corporate sponsors and VIPs was included. Disney asked artist <a href="/wiki/Dorothea_Redmond" title="Dorothea Redmond" class="mw-redirect">Dorothea Redmond</a> to paint renderings and hired Hollywood set director <a href="/w/index.php?title=Emil_Kuri&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Emil Kuri (page does not exist)">Emil Kuri</a> to decorate the facility.<sup id="cite_ref-snopes_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snopes-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> While originally intended for exclusive use by Disneyland's Corporate sponsors and other industry VIPs, when Club 33 opened in May 1967—five months after Disney's death—individual memberships were also offered.</p>
<p>There are various origins that have been claimed for the name "Club 33." One says that Club 33 was named for Disneyland's 33 sponsors at the time, one of which was <a href="/wiki/Chevron_Corporation" title="Chevron Corporation">Chevron</a>. Another explanation is that <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> chose the name simply because he liked the way "33" looked. Another, given by a Club 33 employee, says that since Walt wanted to serve liquor in the Club he had to obtain a liquor license—which requires a full street address. Walt, wanting to protect Disneyland's alcohol-free status, didn't want to use the park's Harbor Boulevard address, so he ordered that all the buildings in New Orleans Square (then under construction) be given addresses. According to the employee, "33" was chosen because Walt's lucky number was 3. One explanation, arguably the most common, is that "33" when turned on its side bears similarity to two letter "M"s, as would stand for "<a href="/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>." It also may be because Disney's only natural born child, Diane Disney Miller, was born in 1933. According to Disneyland tour guides and Club management, it was simply the address assigned to the door by chance—all of the buildings in New Orleans Square have addresses, but they are internally-designated numbers. According to <a href="/wiki/Snopes.com" title="Snopes.com" class="mw-redirect">Snopes.com</a>, the address listed on Disney's liquor license is their general-delivery location.</p>

<p>To enter Club 33, a guest must press a buzzer on an intercom concealed by a hidden panel in the doorway. (At one time, a member needed only to insert his/her membership card in a slot near the buzzer and the door would open. However, this process no longer works.) A receptionist will ask for their name over the intercom and, if access is granted, open the door to a small, ornate lobby. Guests have the option of going to the dining level via an antique-style glass <a href="/wiki/Elevator" title="Elevator">lift</a>. The lift is an exact replica of one Disney saw and fell in love with during a vacation in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, but the owner of the original refused to sell. Undaunted, Disney sent a team of engineers to the Parisian hotel to take exact measurements for use in the creation of a replica; even a sample of the original finish was taken so that it could be duplicated. A staircase to the second level wraps around the lift.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since December 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The second level has two dining rooms. One room has dark wood paneling; the other room is more formal but has a lighter environment.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bloomberg-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Once at the dining level, guests can view antique furniture pieces collected by <a href="/wiki/Lillian_Disney" title="Lillian Disney">Lillian Disney</a>. Walt Disney also handpicked much of the Victorian bric-a-brac in New Orleans antique stores.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bloomberg-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-napavalley_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-napavalley-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The club is also furnished with props from Disney films. There is a fully functional glass <a href="/wiki/Telephone_booth" title="Telephone booth">telephone booth</a> just off the lift that was used in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Happiest_Millionaire" title="The Happiest Millionaire">The Happiest Millionaire</a></i> and an ornate walnut table with white marble top that was used in <i><a href="/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)" title="Mary Poppins (film)">Mary Poppins</a></i>. A video capture from the film on display atop the table shows actors <a href="/wiki/Karen_Dotrice" title="Karen Dotrice">Karen Dotrice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Garber" title="Matthew Garber">Matthew Garber</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Tomlinson" title="David Tomlinson">David Tomlinson</a> standing immediately to its left. A newly-installed bar prepares drinks for members and their guests.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bloomberg-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-napavalley_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-napavalley-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Harpsichord" title="Harpsichord">harpsichord</a> which was rumored to have been an antique was in fact custom-built for Lillian Disney specifically for use in Club 33. The underside of the lid features a <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>-style painting that was actually done by Disney artists. <a href="/wiki/Elton_John" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> has played this harpsichord, and it can be played by anyone who sits at it.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bloomberg-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Walt Disney also wanted to make use of <a href="/wiki/Audio-Animatronic" title="Audio-Animatronic" class="mw-redirect">Audio-Animatronic</a> technology within Club 33. Microphones in overhead lighting fixtures would pick up the sounds of normal conversation while an operator would respond via the characters. Though the system was never fully implemented, it was partially installed and remains so to this day. An Audio-Animatronic <a href="/wiki/Vulture" title="Vulture">vulture</a> is perched in one corner of the club's "Trophy Room." The microphones are clearly visible at the bottom of each of the room's lighting fixtures. The animal trophies (Walt inherited them from a friend), for which the room was named, have been removed by Disney family members. Photos of the room with the trophies still installed can be seen on the walls now.<sup id="cite_ref-bloomberg_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bloomberg-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-napavalley_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-napavalley-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Disneyland guests participating in the "Walk In Walt's Footsteps" tour are provided entrance to the lobby of Club 33. The tour guide will provide a brief history of the club and explain some of the artifacts in the lobby. The tour members may be photographed in the lift, but are not allowed upstairs.<sup id="cite_ref-footsteps_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-footsteps-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Club_33&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Membership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Membership</span></h2>
<p>There are two types of Club 33 membership: corporate and individual. As of February 2008 the current membership levels are Corporate Membership, Limited Corporate Membership, and individual Gold Membership. The Corporate and Limited Corporate Memberships allow for transfer of members, while individual memberships are non-transferable. In the late 1990s, Club 33 offered a lower tier of individual membership, the Silver Membership. However, this level of membership was discontinued. As of June 2007, the membership waiting list was 14 years, and membership interest list was closed to new inquiries as of April/May 2007.</p>
<p>Prior to the closure of the membership interest list, those interested in membership would send a written letter of inquiry to Disney. They would then have received a confirmation letter and information packet. Currently, letters of inquiry are replied to with a letter explaining that the interest list is closed, and no new additions are being made to the list. For those waiting on the list, as memberships open, potential members are informed via a letter of intent from Disney.</p>
<p>Initial fees and annual dues vary by membership.</p>
<p>The Corporate Membership fee is $27,500 plus $6,100 in annual fees. Up to nine associate members can be designated at an annual fee of $4,650 each. Members no longer in the employment of the corporate member's company must surrender the membership cards to Club 33. The corporate member may then designate another member of the company.</p>
<p>The Limited Corporate Membership fee is $13,750 with only one member at an annual fee of $4,650. This entitles the corporation to transfer the membership to another employee whenever necessary.</p>
<p>The Gold Membership is for an individual with a member fee of $10,450 and an annual fee of $3,275. Additional use of a membership card is by spouse only, with reservations accepted only from the cardholder, the spouse, or the cardholder's assistant. The Gold Membership is not transferable.</p>
<p>Members at any level are allowed to make personal reservations 90 days in advance and guest reservations 60 days in advance. Private parties utilizing the entire Club facilities for special occasions such as birthdays, holiday parties, and business functions are available upon member's request with a required minimum number of guests. For an additional fee, members may request any of Disney's costumed characters to appear at the club, as Disney believes "special events [are] always more fun with Mickey or Donald."</p>
<p>The member and one guest (or spouse) receive complimentary admission to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure at any time whether or not they eat at the Club. Club members and up to nine guests are allowed complimentary admission when dining at the Club. If the member is unable to accompany the guests to Club 33, the Club will arrange admission for them at no charge. Club members receive complimentary parking.</p>
