<p>Koresh was born as <b>Vernon Wayne Howell</b> in <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, to a 14-year-old single mother, Bonnie Sue Clark.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> His father was a 20-year-old man named Bobby Howell. The pair remained unmarried. Two months before Koresh was born, his father met another <a href="/wiki/Pubescent" title="Pubescent" class="mw-redirect">pubescent</a> girl and abandoned Bonnie Sue. Koresh never met his father and his mother began <a href="/wiki/Cohabitation" title="Cohabitation">cohabiting</a> with a violent alcoholic.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1963, Koresh's mother left her boyfriend and placed her 4-year-old son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Earline Clark. His mother returned when he was seven, after she remarried to a carpenter named Roy Haldeman. Haldeman and Clark had a son together named Roger, who was born in 1968.</p>
<p>Koresh described his early childhood as lonely, and it has been alleged that he was once <a href="/wiki/Gangrape" title="Gangrape" class="mw-redirect">gangraped</a> by older boys when he was 8.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> A poor student who was <a href="/wiki/Illiterate" title="Illiterate" class="mw-redirect">illiterate</a> and diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Dyslexia" title="Dyslexia">dyslexia</a>, Koresh dropped out of Garland High School in his junior year. Due to his poor study skills, he was put in <a href="/wiki/Special_ed" title="Special ed">special ed</a> classes and nicknamed "Vernie" by his fellow students,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but by the age of 11, he had memorized the entire <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>When he was 19, Koresh had an affair with a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> He claimed to have become a born-again Christian in the <a href="/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Church" title="Southern Baptist Church" class="mw-redirect">Southern Baptist Church</a> and soon joined his mother's church, the <a href="/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church" title="Seventh-day Adventist Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>. There he fell in love with the pastor's daughter and while praying for guidance he opened his eyes and allegedly found the Bible open at <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah 34</a>, stating that none should want for a mate; convinced this was a sign from God, he approached the pastor and told him that God wanted him to have his daughter for a wife. The pastor threw him out, and when he continued to persist with his pursuit of the daughter he was expelled from the congregation.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1981 he moved to <a href="/wiki/Waco,_Texas" title="Waco, Texas">Waco, Texas</a>, where he joined the <a href="/wiki/Branch_Davidians" title="Branch Davidians" class="mw-redirect">Branch Davidians</a>, a religious group originating from a schism in the 1950s from the <a href="/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Rod" title="Shepherd's Rod">Shepherd's Rod</a>, themselves disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1930s.

<p>In 1983 he began claiming the gift of <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a>. Koresh then had a sexual relationship with <a href="/wiki/Lois_Roden" title="Lois Roden">Lois Roden</a>, the prophetess and leader of the sect who was then 78 years old, eventually claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the Chosen One.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1983, Roden allowed Koresh to begin teaching his own message which caused controversy in the group. Lois Roden's son <a href="/wiki/George_Roden" title="George Roden">George Roden</a> intended to be the group's next leader and considered Koresh an interloper. When Koresh announced that God had instructed him to marry Rachel Jones, there was a short period of calm at Mount Carmel, but it proved only temporary. In the ensuing power struggle, George Roden, claiming to have the support of the majority of the group, forced Koresh and his group off the property at gunpoint. Disturbed by the events and the move away from the philosophy of the community's founders, a further splinter group led by Charles Joseph Pace moved out of Mount Carmel and set up home in <a href="/wiki/Gadsden,_Alabama" title="Gadsden, Alabama">Gadsden, Alabama</a>.</p>
<p>Koresh and around 25 followers set up camp at <a href="/wiki/Palestine,_Texas" title="Palestine, Texas">Palestine, Texas</a>, 90 miles from Waco, where they lived rough for the next two years, during which time Koresh undertook recruitment of new followers in California, the United Kingdom, Israel and Australia. In 1985 Koresh traveled to Israel and it was there that he claimed he had a vision that he was the modern day <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus</a>. The founder of the Davidian movement, <a href="/wiki/Victor_Houteff" title="Victor Houteff">Victor Houteff</a>, wanted to be God's implement and establish the Davidic kingdom in Palestine, Israel. Koresh also wanted to be God's tool and set up the Davidic kingdom in Jerusalem. At least until 1990, he believed the place of his martyrdom might be in Israel, but by 1991 he was convinced that his martyrdom would be in the United States. Instead of Israel, he said the prophecies of Daniel would be fulfilled in Waco and that the Mount Carmel center was the Davidic kingdom.<sup id="cite_ref-valentine_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-valentine-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At the Palestine, Texas, camp, Koresh "worked it so that everyone was forced to rely on him, and him alone. All previous bonds and attachments, family or otherwise, meant nothing. His rationale was if they had no one to depend on, they had to depend on him, and that made them vulnerable."<sup id="cite_ref-samuelson_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-samuelson-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> By this time, he had already begun to give the message of his own "Christhood," proclaiming that he was "the Son of God, the Lamb who could open the <a href="/wiki/Seven_seals" title="Seven seals">Seven Seals</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-valentine_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-valentine-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Lois Roden died in 1986. Up until then Koresh had been teaching that monogamy was the only way to live, but suddenly announced that <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> was allowed for him. In March 1986, Koresh first slept with Karen Doyle, aged 14.<sup id="cite_ref-mann_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mann-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> He claimed her as his second wife. In August 1986, Koresh began secretly sleeping with Michele Jones, his wife's younger 12-year-old sister. In September 1986 Koresh began to preach that he was entitled to 140 wives, 60 women as his "queens" and 80 as <a href="/wiki/Concubines" title="Concubines" class="mw-redirect">concubines</a>, which he based upon his interpretation of the Biblical <a href="/wiki/Song_of_Solomon" title="Song of Solomon" class="mw-redirect">Song of Solomon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-samuelson_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-samuelson-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Koresh then built up an entirely new theology around his "marriage" to Doyle. This theology was called the "New Light," with a doctrine of polygamy for himself, which he called "The House of David." According to this doctrine, Doyle was supposed to have a daughter named Shoshanna who would then be married to Koresh's firstborn son Cyrus. However, Doyle failed to conceive, so Koresh then transferred his attention to his wife's sister. Former Davidian David Bunds said that Koresh's doctrine of polygamy "rose out of his deep desire to have sex with young girls. Once he was able to convince himself that it was God's will then he was able to be free of guilt and have sex with as many young girls as he could get his hands on."<sup id="cite_ref-mann_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mann-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By late 1987, George Roden's support had withered. To regain it, he challenged Koresh to a contest to raise the dead, even digging up one corpse to practice on it. Koresh went to authorities to file charges of corpse abuse against Roden, but was told he would have to show proof (such as a photograph of the corpse). Koresh returned to Mount Carmel in camouflage, with seven armed followers. All but one - who managed to escape - were arrested by the local police, who had been alerted by the sound of gunfire.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> When deputy sheriffs arrived, they found Koresh and six followers firing their rifles at Roden, who was also armed. Roden had already suffered a minor gunshot wound and was pinned down behind a tree at the Compound. The sheriff called into the chapel by telephone and talked Koresh into surrender.<sup id="cite_ref-report_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-report-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result of the incident, Koresh and his followers were charged with attempted murder. At the trial, Koresh testified that he went to Mount Carmel to uncover evidence of corpse abuse by George Roden. Koresh's followers were acquitted, and in Koresh's case a <a href="/wiki/Trial_(law)" title="Trial (law)">mistrial</a> was declared.</p>
<p>In 1988 Roden murdered Dale Adair with an axe blow to the skull after Adair stated his belief that Koresh was the Messiah. Roden was convicted of murder and imprisoned in a mental hospital at Vernon, Texas. Because Roden owed thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes, Mount Carmel was placed for sale. Koresh and his followers raised the money and purchased the property, which he subsequently renamed "Ranch Apocalypse."<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Roden continued to harass the Koresh faction by filing legal papers while imprisoned. When Koresh and his followers reclaimed Mt. Carmel, they discovered that tenants who had rented from Roden had left behind a <a href="/wiki/Methamphetamine" title="Methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> laboratory, which Koresh reported to the local police department and asked to have removed.<sup id="cite_ref-thibodeau_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-thibodeau-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The name <i>Koresh</i> is a transliteration of the Hebrew name of <a href="/wiki/Cyrus_II_of_Persia" title="Cyrus II of Persia" class="mw-redirect">Cyrus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Persian king</a> who allowed the Jews who had been <a href="/wiki/Diaspora" title="Diaspora">dispersed</a> throughout <a href="/wiki/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> by <a href="/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II_of_Babylon" title="Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon" class="mw-redirect">Nebuchadnezzar</a> to return to their homelands. During the siege, Koresh would explain to the FBI negotiators that (in Koresh's mind at least) "koresh" had a deeper meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koresh: "What is Christ revealed as, according to the fourth seal?"<br />
FBI: "Pale... a rider on a pale horse."<br />
Koresh: "And his name is what?"<br />
FBI: "Death."<br />
Koresh: "Now, do you know what the name Koresh means?"<br />

<p>Koresh himself denied all allegations of polygamy and child abuse in public interviews. The popular media, disaffected Davidians, and spokespersons for the US government, however, tell sordid tales of Koresh's personal life.</p>
<p>It has been alleged that Koresh advocated <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> for himself, and asserted that he was married to several female residents of the small community.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-report_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-report-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Some former members of the cult also alleged that Koresh felt he could claim any of the females in the compound as his.<sup id="cite_ref-wilson_0-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wilson-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-report_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-report-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The 1993 U.S. Department of Justice report sets out allegations of historical child sexual and physical abuse. ATF Special Agent David Aguilera had interviewed former Branch Davidian Jeannine Bunds, who claimed that Koresh had fathered at least fifteen children with various women and young girls at the compound. According to Bunds, some of the girls who had babies fathered by Koresh were as young as 12 years old. She said she had personally delivered seven of these children. Bunds also claims that Koresh would annul all marriages of couples who joined his cult. He then had exclusive sexual access to the women. He would also have regular sexual relations with young girls.<sup id="cite_ref-dpmt_justice_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dpmt_justice-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> In his book, James Tabor states that Koresh acknowledged on a videotape sent out of the compound during the standoff that he had fathered more than 12 children by several "wives," some of whom were as young as 12 or 13 when they became pregnant.<sup id="cite_ref-tabor_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-tabor-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> DNA testing of the women and children in the video who died in the subsequent fire confirmed that some of the children were his.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> On March 3, 1993, during negotiations to secure the release of the remaining children, Koresh advised the Negotiation Team that: "My children are different than those others" referring to his direct lineage, versus those children previously released. At the time, in Texas, the age of <a href="/wiki/Parental_consent" title="Parental consent">parental consent</a> for a <a href="/wiki/Marriageable_age" title="Marriageable age">minor to marry</a> was 14, as was the age for consent to engage in sexual relations.</p>
<p>Kiri Jewell, daughter of Branch Davidian Sherri Jewell, claimed in testimony before Congress in 1995 that she was sexually molested at the age of 10 by Koresh, who then read to her from the Bible. She originally related the incident in a 1992 custody battle, and the judge ordered that she be kept away from Koresh and Mount Carmel.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> While conceding that Jewell's testimony may be true, Schneider's attorney expressed doubts about the veracity of her evidence.</p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Waco_Siege" title="Waco Siege">Waco Siege</a></div>
<p>On February 28, 1993, the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco_and_Firearms" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms" class="mw-redirect">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</a> (BATF) raided <a href="/wiki/Mount_Carmel_Center" title="Mount Carmel Center">Mount Carmel</a>. The raid resulted in the deaths of four agents and six Davidians. Shortly after the initial raid, the <a href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI" class="mw-redirect">FBI</a> HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) took command of the federal operation, since FBI has jurisdiction over incidents involving the deaths of federal agents. Contact was established with Koresh inside the compound. Communication over the next 51 days included telephone exchanges with various FBI negotiators.</p>
<p>As the standoff continued, Koresh, who was seriously injured by a gunshot wound, along with his closest male leaders negotiated delays, possibly so he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations with the negotiators were dense with biblical imagery. The federal negotiators treated the situation as a hostage crisis despite a two hour video tape sent out by the Davidians in which the adults and older children/teens appeared to explain clearly and confidently why they chose of their own free will to remain with Koresh.</p>
<p>The 51-day siege of Mount Carmel ended when U.S Attorney General <a href="/wiki/Janet_Reno" title="Janet Reno">Janet Reno</a> approved recommendations of veteran FBI officials to proceed with a final assault in which the Branch Davidians were to be removed from their building by force. In the course of the assault, the church building caught fire. The cause of the fire was later alleged by the "Danforth Report," a report commissioned by The Special Counsel, to be the deliberate actions of some of the Branch Davidians inside the building.<sup id="cite_ref-danforth_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-danforth-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> However this hypothesis is disputed in the documentary "<a href="/wiki/Waco:_The_Rules_of_Engagement" title="Waco: The Rules of Engagement">Waco: The Rules of Engagement</a>," which argues that the fire was deliberately set when the FBI fired an incendiary device into the building after loading the building with <a href="/wiki/CS_gas" title="CS gas">CS gas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-policeone_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-policeone-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> At the subsequent trial of the surviving Branch Davidians, the jury listened to edited parts of a tape-recording from hidden microphones inside Mt. Carmel during the final attack and fire of 19 April. These consisted of sounds of static during which one could faintly hear a voice saying ". . . fire . . . ". A government expert testified that through electronic enhancement, he had reconstructed some clearly incriminating comments, even if the jury couldn't hear them.<sup id="cite_ref-tausch_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-tausch-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> It later transpired that the FBI, when meeting Koresh's demands that milk be sent in for the children's wellbeing, also sent in tiny listening devices concealed inside the milk cartons and their styrofoam containers.<sup id="cite_ref-jamar_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jamar-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Barricaded in their building, seventy-six Branch Davidians, including Koresh, did not survive the fire. Seventeen of these victims were children under the age of 17. The Danforth Report claims that those who died were unable, or unwilling, to flee and that Steve Schneider, Koresh's right-hand man, probably shot Koresh and killed himself with the same gun. "<a href="/wiki/Waco:_The_Rules_of_Engagement" title="Waco: The Rules of Engagement">Waco: The Rules of Engagement</a>" claims that FBI sharpshooters fired on, and killed, many Branch Davidians who attempted to flee the flames. Testimony by the few Branch Davidians who did successfully flee the fire supports this claim. Autopsy records indicate that at least 20 Branch Davidians were shot, including 5 children. The Danforth Report concluded that the adults who died of gunshot wounds shot themselves after shooting the children.</p>
<p>David Koresh is buried at Memorial Park Cemetery, <a href="/wiki/Tyler,_Texas" title="Tyler, Texas">Tyler, Texas</a>.</p>
<p>On January 23, 2009, Koresh's mother, Bonnie Clark Haldeman, was stabbed to death in <a href="/wiki/Chandler,_Texas" title="Chandler, Texas">Chandler, Texas</a>.
