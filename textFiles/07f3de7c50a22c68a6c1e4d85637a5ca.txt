[edit] Personal life




Dennis and Elizabeth Kucinich in 2008


Kucinich was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 8, 1946, as the eldest of the seven children of Frank and Virginia Kucinich.[2] His father, a truck driver, was of Croatian ancestry; his Irish American mother was a homemaker.[3] Growing up, his family moved 21 times and Kucinich was often charged with the responsibility of finding apartments they could afford.[4]
He attended Cleveland State University from 1967 to 1970.[5] In 1973, he graduated from Case Western Reserve University with both a Bachelor of Arts and an Master of Arts (postgraduate) degrees in speech and communication.[6] Kucinich was baptized a Roman Catholic.[5] He is twice divorced, with a daughter, Jackie, from his marriage to Sandra Lee McCarthy. He married his third wife, Elizabeth Harper, a British citizen, on August 21, 2005. The two met while Harper was working as an assistant for the Chicago-based American Monetary Institute, which brought her to Kucinich's House of Representatives office for a meeting. She is 31 years younger than Kucinich.[7]
Dennis was raised with four brothers, Larry, Frank, Gary and Perry; and two sisters, Theresa and Beth Ann. On December 19, 2007, Perry Kucinich, the youngest brother, was found dead in his apartment.[8][9][10] On November 11, 2008, his youngest sister, Beth Ann Kucinich, also died.[11][citation needed]

[edit] Recognition
In 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award, an annual award bestowed by the Religious Society of Friends-affiliated organization Promoting Enduring Peace.[2]

[edit] Early career
Kucinich's political career began early. After running unsuccessfully in 1967, Kucinich was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1969 at the age of twenty-three.[3] In 1972, Kucinich ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing narrowly to incumbent Republican William E. Minshall, Jr. After Minshall's retirement in 1974 Kucinich sought the seat again, this time failing to get the Democratic nomination, which instead went to Ronald M. Mottl. Kucinich ran as an Independent candidate in the general election, placing third with about 30% of the vote. In 1975, Kucinich became clerk of the municipal court in Cleveland and served in that position for two years.[12]

[edit] Cleveland mayoralty, 1977–1979
Main article: Mayoral administration of Dennis Kucinich
Kucinich was elected Mayor of Cleveland in 1977 and served in that position until 1979.[13] At thirty-one years of age, he was the youngest mayor of a major city in the United States,[3] earning him the nickname "the boy mayor of Cleveland".[14] Kucinich's tenure as mayor is often regarded as one of the most tumultuous in Cleveland's history.[15][14] After Kucinich refused to sell Muni Light, Cleveland's publicly owned electric utility, the Cleveland mafia put out a hit on Kucinich. A hitman from Maryland planned to shoot him in the head during the Columbus Day Parade, but the plot fell apart when Kucinich was hospitalized and missed the event. When the city fell into default shortly thereafter, the mafia leaders called off the contract killer.[16]
In the book Best and Worst of the Big-City Leaders, 1820–1993, Melvin G. Holli, in consultation with a panel of selected experts, claimed Kucinich to be among the ten worst big-city mayors of all time, while Kucinich's supporters say that Kucinich kept his campaign promise of refusing to sell Muni Light to CEI and was brave for not giving in to big business.[citation needed] Specifically, it was the Cleveland Trust Company that suddenly required all of the city's debts be paid in full, which forced the city into default, after news of Kucinich's refusal to sell the city utility. For years these debts were routinely rolled over, pending future payment, until Kucinich's announcement was made public. In 1998 the council honored him for having the "courage and foresight" to stand up to the banks and saving the city an estimated $195 million between 1985 and 1995.[17]

[edit] Post-mayoralty
After losing his re-election bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich kept a low profile in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine.[18] During the next three years, Kucinich earned money as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant.[5] It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it.[18] On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38.[18] When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, "When I was growing up in Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through."[18]




Kucinich gestures to the audience following his speech on the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.


In 1982, Kucinich moved back to Cleveland and ran for Secretary of State; however, he lost the Democratic primary to Sherrod Brown.[18] In 1983, Kucinich won a special election to fill the seat of a Cleveland city councilman who had died.[19] His brother, Gary Kucinich, was also a councilman at the time.
In 1985, there was some speculation that Kucinich might run for mayor again. Instead his brother Gary ran against (and lost to) the incumbent Voinovich. Kucinich, meanwhile, gave up his council position to run for Governor of Ohio as an independent against Richard Celeste, but later withdrew from the race.[19] After this, Kucinich, in his own words "on a quest for meaning," lived quietly in New Mexico until 1994, when he won a seat in the Ohio State Senate.[19] "He was in political Siberia in the 1980s," said Joseph Tegreene years later. "It was only when it became clear to people that he was right... he got belated recognition for the things that he did."
In 1996, Kucinich was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the 10th district of Ohio. He defeated two-term Republican incumbent Martin Hoke by three percentage points. However, he has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has since been re-elected six times.[20]
On August 27, 2008, he delivered a widely publicized speech at the Democratic National Convention.[21]

[edit] Domestic policy voting record
Main article: Political positions of Dennis Kucinich




Kucinich outside the Capitol in June 2007


Kucinich helped introduce and is one of 87 cosponsors in the House of Representatives of the United States National Health Insurance Act or HR 676 proposed by Rep. John Conyers in 2003,[22] which provides for a universal single-payer public health-insurance plan.
His voting record is not always in line with that of the Democratic Party. Kucinich voted against the USA PATRIOT Act, against the Military Commissions Act of 2006,[23] and was one of six who voted against the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Act.[24] He also voted for authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to investigate whether sufficient grounds existed for the impeachment of Bill Clinton.[25]
Kucinich criticized the flag-burning amendment and voted against the impeachment of President Clinton. His congressional voting record has leaned strongly toward a pro-life stance, although he noted that he has never supported a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion altogether. But in 2003, he began describing himself as pro-choice and said he had shifted away from his earlier position on the issue.[26] Press releases have indicated that he is pro-choice and supports ending the abstinence-only policy of sex education and increasing the use of contraception to make abortion "less necessary" over time. His voting record since 2003 has reflected his pro choice stance.
He has criticized Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions) for promoting voting machines that fail to leave a traceable paper trail, and posted on his website internal company memos in which company executives promised to deliver the 2004 Ohio election to Bush.[27] He was one of the thirty-one who voted in the House to not count the electoral votes from Ohio in the United States presidential election, 2004.[28]

[edit] Foreign policy record
Kucinich has criticized the foreign policy of President Bush, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq and what he perceives as growing American hostility towards Iran. He has always voted against funding it. In 2005, he voted against the Iran Freedom and Support Act, calling it a "stepping stone to war".[29] He also signed a letter of solidarity with Hugo Chávez in Venezuela in 2004.[30]
He advocates the abolition of all nuclear weapons, calling on the United States to be the leader in multilateral disarmament.[31] Kucinich has also strongly opposed space-based weapons and has sponsored legislation, HR 2977, banning the deployment and use of space-based weapons.[32]
Kucinich advocates US withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) because, in his view, it causes the loss of more American jobs than it creates, and does not provide adequate protections for worker rights and safety and environmental safeguards. He is against the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) for the same reason.[33]
Kucinich is also in favor of increased dialog with Iran in order to avoid a militaristic confrontation at all costs. He expressed such sentiments at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey which included Chuck Hagel, Javad Zarif, Nicholas Kristof, and Anders Liden to discuss Iranian-American relations, and potential ways to increase dialog in order to avoid conflict.[34]
He believes the US should move aggressively to reduce emissions that cause climate change due to global warming[35] and should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a major international agreement signed by over 160 countries to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by each signatory.[36]
Kucinich and Ron Paul are the only two congressional representatives who voted[37] against the Rothman-Kirk Resolution,[38] which calls on the United Nations to charge Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with violating the genocide convention of the United Nations Charter based on statements that he has made. Kucinich defended his vote by saying that Ahmadinejad's statements could be translated to mean that he wants a regime change in Israel, not death to its people and supporters, and that the resolution is an attempt to beat "the war drum to build support for a US attack on Iran."[39]
On January 9, 2009, Kucinich was one of the dissenters in a 390-5 vote with 22 abstentions for a resolution recognizing Israel's "right to defend itself [against Hamas rocket attacks]" and reaffirming the U.S.'s support for Israel. The other 4 "no" votes were Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, Maxine Waters of California, Nick Rahall of West Virginia, and Ron Paul of Texas. [40]
Kucinich is the only congressional representative to vote against[41] the symbolic "9/11 Commemoration" resolution.[42] In a press statement[43] he defended his vote by saying that the bill did not make reference to "the lies that took us into Iraq, the lies that keep us there, the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home."
In a visit to the rest of the Middle East in September 2007, Kucinich said he did not visit Iraq because "I feel the United States is engaging in an illegal occupation."[44] Kucinich was criticized for his visit to Syria and praise of the President Bashar al-Assad on Syria's national TV.[45] He praised Syria for taking in Iraqi refugees. "What most people are not aware of is that Syria has taken in more than 1.5 million Iraqi refugees," Kucinich said. "The Syrian government has actually shown a lot of compassion in keeping its doors open, and being a host for so many refugees."[46]
Despite Kucinich's committed opposition to the war in Iraq, in the days after the September 11, 2001 attacks he did vote to authorize President Bush broad war making powers,[47] the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The Authorization was used by the Bush Administration in its justification for suspension of habeas corpus in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and its wiretapping of American citizens under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Kucinich voted along with 419 of his House colleagues in favor of this resolution, while only one Congresswoman opposed, Representative Barbara Lee.

[edit] 2004 Presidential campaign




Kucinich speaks out against the occupation of Iraq at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.


Kucinich was criticized during his 2004 campaign for changing his stance on the issue of abortion.[26] His explanation was "I've always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women to be able to have an abortion if they need to protect their health. So when I saw the direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose."[48]
Ralph Nader praised Kucinich as "a genuine progressive,"[citation needed] and most Greens were friendly to Kucinich's campaign, some going so far as to indicate that they would not have run against him had he won the Democratic nomination. However, Kucinich was unable to carry any states in the 2004 Democratic Primaries, and John Kerry eventually won the Democratic nomination at the Democratic National Convention.

[edit] Press coverage
On December 10, 2003, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced the removal of its correspondents from the campaigns of Kucinich, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton.[49]
The announcement came one day after a Democratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News' Ted Koppel, in which Koppel asked whether the candidacies of Kucinich, Moseley Braun and Sharpton were merely "vanity campaigns," and Koppel and Kucinich exchanged uncomfortable dialog.[50]
Kucinich, previously critical of the limited coverage given his campaign, characterized ABC's decision as an example of media companies' power to shape campaigns by choosing which candidates to cover and questioned its timing, coming immediately after the debate.[49]
ABC News, while stating its commitment to give coverage to a wide range of candidates, argued that focusing more of its "finite resources" on those candidates most likely to win would best serve the public debate.[50]

[edit] Polls and primaries
In the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination race, national polls consistently showed Kucinich's support in single digits, but rising, especially as Howard Dean lost some support among peace activists for refusing to commit to cutting the Pentagon budget. Though he was not viewed as a viable contender by most, there were differing polls on Kucinich's popularity.
He placed second in MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, particularly Internet-based ones. This led many activists to believe that his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls had been saying. However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.
In the Iowa caucuses he finished fifth, receiving about 1% of the state delegates from Iowa; far below the 15% threshold for receiving national delegates. He performed similarly in the New Hampshire primary, placing sixth among the seven candidates with 1% of the vote. In the Mini-Tuesday primaries he finished near the bottom in most states, with his best performance in New Mexico where he received less than 6% of the vote, and still no delegates. Kucinich's best showing in any Democratic contest was in the February 24 Hawaii caucus, in which he won 31% of caucus participants, coming in second place to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and winning Maui County, the only county won by Kucinich in either of his presidential campaigns. He also saw a double-digit showing in Maine on February 8, where he got 16% percent in that state's caucus.
On Super Tuesday, March 2, Kucinich gained another strong showing with the Minnesota caucus, where 17% of the ballots went to him. In his home state of Ohio, he gained 9% in the primary.
Kucinich campaigned heavily in Oregon, spending 30 days there during the two months leading up to the state's May 18 primary. He continued his campaign because "the future direction of the Democratic Party has not yet been determined"[51] and chose to focus on Oregon "because of its progressive tradition and its pioneering spirit."[52] He even offered to campaign jointly with Kerry during Kerry's visit to the state, though the offer was ignored.[citation needed] He won 16% of the vote.
Even after Kerry won enough delegates to secure the nomination, Kucinich continued to campaign until just before the convention, citing an effort to help shape the agenda of the Democratic Party. He was the last candidate to end his campaign. He endorsed Kerry on July 22, four days before the start of the Democratic National Convention.[53]

[edit] 2008 Presidential campaign
Main article: Dennis Kucinich presidential campaign, 2008




Kucinich speaking on the campaign trail, January 2007.


On December 11, 2006 in a speech delivered at Cleveland City Hall, Kucinich announced he would seek the nomination of the Democratic Party for President in 2008. His platform[54] for 2008 included:

Creating a single-payer not-for-profit system of universal health care that provides full coverage for all Americans by passage of the United States National Health Insurance Act.
The immediate, phased withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq; replacing them with an international security force.
Guaranteed quality education for all; including free pre-kindergarten and college for all who want it.
Immediate withdrawal from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Immediate repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act.
Fostering a world of international cooperation.
Abolishing the death penalty.
Environmental renewal and clean energy.
Creating a moratorium on Genetically Modified Organism (GMO).
Implementation of H.R. 676, which integrates traditional medicine with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
Ban offshore drilling.
Halt all Biochemical Aerial Spraying of Pesticides and other toxins.
Preventing the privatization of social security.
Providing full social security benefits at age 65.
Creating a cabinet-level "Department of Peace"
Ratifying the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol.
Introducing reforms to bring about instant-runoff voting.
Protecting a woman's "right to choose" while decreasing the number of abortions performed in the U.S.
Ending the War on Drugs.
Legalizing same-sex marriage.
Strongly promoting workers' rights.
Ending the H-1B and L-1 visa Programs
Restoring rural communities and family farms.
Strengthening gun control.
Legalizing medicinal marijuana and decriminalizing non-medical possession.

Kucinich described his stance on the issues as mainstream.[55] "My politics are center for the Democratic party," he said in an interview before an AFL-CIO sponsored debate.[citation needed]
Kucinich told his supporters in Iowa that if he did not appear on the second ballot in any caucus that they should back Barack Obama:

"I hope Iowans will caucus for me as their first choice ... because of my singular positions on the war, on health care and trade," Kucinich said. "But in those caucus locations where my support doesn't reach the necessary threshold, I strongly encourage all of my supporters to make Barack Obama their second choice."[56][dead link][57]

At a debate of Democratic presidential candidates in Philadelphia on October 30, 2007, NBC's Tim Russert cited a passage from a book by Shirley MacLaine in which the author writes that Kucinich had seen a UFO from her home in Washington State. Russert asked if MacLaine's assertion was true. Kucinich confirmed and emphasized that he merely meant he had seen an unidentified flying object, just as former US president Jimmy Carter has.[58][59] Russert then cited a statistic that 14% of Americans say they have witnessed a UFO.[58] The next day, Russert's "UFO question" drew harsh criticism from Kucinich's fellow candidate, former Senator from Alaska, Mike Gravel:

"Once again Russert assumed his role as the establishment's Hatchetman. Last debate, he sandbagged me with the bankruptcy question. This time he clocked Dennis with the UFO. When is Russert going to ask Hillary about the billing records or the cattle futures during a debate? Russert is America's most overrated journalist..." [60]

On November 16, 2007, Larry Flynt hosted a fundraiser for Kucinich at the Los Angeles-based Hustler-LFP headquarters, attended by Kucinich and his wife, which has drawn criticism from Flynt's detractors. Attendees included such notables as Edward Norton, Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, Melissa Etheridge, Tammy Etheridge, Stephen Stills, Kristen Stills, Frances Fisher, and Esai Morales. Campaign spokesmen have declined to comment.[61][62][63]
In December 2007, author Gore Vidal endorsed Kucinich for president.[64]
Kucinich's 2008 presidential campaign was advised by a steering committee including Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) Founder Steve Cobble, long-time Kucinich press secretary Andy Junewicz, former Carter Fundraiser Kenneth Brandon, Ani DiFranco Tour Manager Susan Alzner, West Point Graduate and former Army Captain Mike Klein and New Jersey-based political consultant Vin Gopal. The campaign was seen as a platform to push progressive issues into the Democratic Party, including a not-for-profit health care system, same-sex marriage, increasing the minimum wage, opposing capital punishment, and impeachment.
On Monday, January 7, 2008 actor Viggo Mortensen endorsed Kucinich's presidential campaign in New Hampshire.[65] On Thursday, January 10, 2008, Kucinich asked for a New Hampshire recount based on discrepancies between the machine-counted ballots and the hand-counted ballots. He stated that he wanted to make sure "100% of the voters had 100% of their votes counted."[66]
On Tuesday, January 15, 2008, Kucinich was "disinvited" from a Democratic presidential debate on MSNBC. A ruling that the debate could not go ahead without Kucinich was overturned on appeal.[67] Kucinich later responded to the questions posed in the MSNBC debate in a show hosted by Democracy Now!.[68]
Kucinich dropped his bid for the Democratic nomination on Thursday, January 24, 2008, and did not endorse any other candidate. He later endorsed Barack Obama after he had won the nomination.[69] [70] On Friday, January 25, 2008, he made a formal announcement of the end of his campaign for president and his focus on reelection to congress.[71]

[edit] Congressional campaigns
Kucinich has always been reelected to Congress by sound margins in his strongly Democratic-leaning district. Kucinich has so far won primary challenges against him for the Democratic nomination convincingly. In the most recent general election (2006), Kucinich defeated another Democratic primary challenger by a wide margin and defeated Republican Mike Dovilla in the general election with 66% of the vote.

[edit] 2008 re-election bid
See also: United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2008#District 10
His opponents included Cleveland City Councilman Joe Cimperman and North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O'Grady. In February Kucinich raised around $50,000 compared to Cimperman's $228,000 [72], but through a YouTube money-raising campaign he managed to raise $700,000, surpassing Cimperman's $487,000.[73][74]
Cimperman, who was endorsed by the Mayor of Cleveland and the Cleveland Plain Dealer, criticized Kucinich for focusing too much on campaigning for president and not on the district. Kucinich accused Cimperman of representing corporate and real estate interests. Cimperman described Kucinich as an absentee congressman who failed to pass any major legislative initiatives in his 12-year House career. In an interview, Cimperman said he was tired of Kucinich and Cleveland being joke fodder for late-night talk-show hosts, saying "It's time for him to go home."[75][76] An ad paid for by Cimperman's campaign claimed that Kucinich has missed over 300 votes, but by checking the ad's source the actual number was 139.[77][78] However, Kucinich is well known for his constituency service.[79]
A report suggested that representatives of Nancy Pelosi and American Israel Public Affairs Committee would "guarantee" Kucinich's re-election if he dropped his bid to impeach Dick Cheney and George W. Bush, though Kucinich denies the meeting happened.[80][81] It was also suggested that Kucinich's calls for universal health care and an immediate withdrawal from Iraq made him a thorn in the side of the Democrats' congressional leadership, as well as his refusal to pledge to support the eventual presidential nominee, which he later reconsidered.[75]
Kucinich took part in a debate with the other primary challengers. Barbara Ferris criticized him for not bringing as much money back to the district as other area legislators and authoring just one bill that passed during his 12 years in Congress. Kucinich responded "It was a Republican Congress and there weren't many Democrats passing meaningful legislation during a Republican Congress."[82]
Kucinich won the primary, receiving 68,156 votes out of a total of 135,589 cast to beat Cimperman 52% to 33%.[83]
Kucinich defeated former State Representative Jim Trakas in the November 4, 2008 general election with 153,357 votes, 56.8% of those cast.

[edit] Positions
Based on his voting record in Congress, the American Conservative Union (ACU) gave Kucinich a conservative rating of 9.73%,[84] and for 2008, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) gave him a liberal rating of 95%.[85]

[edit] Monetary Reform
In the aftermath of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 Kucinich calls for the Federal Reserve System to be put under control of U.S. Treasury[86]. Additionally, banks shall no longer be allowed to create money, putting an end to Fractional-reserve banking[87]. He cites Stephen Zarlenga as the initiatior of that proposal.

[edit] Plan for Iraq
On January 8, 2007 Dennis Kucinich unveiled his comprehensive exit plan to bring the troops home and stabilize Iraq. His plan includes the following steps:[88]

Announce that the US will end the occupation, close the military bases, and withdraw.
Announce that existing funds will be used to bring the troops and the necessary equipment home.
Order a simultaneous return of all US contractors to the US and turn over the contracting work to the Iraqi government.
Convene a regional conference for developing a security and stabilization force for Iraq.

[edit] Space Preservation Act of 2001
Kucinich introduced the first Space Preservation Act, on October 2, 2001, with no cosponsors. The bill was designed to "preserve the cooperative, peaceful uses of space for the benefit of all humankind." The bill was referred to the House Science, the House Armed Services, and the House International Relations committees. The bill died in committee (April 9, 2002) because of an unfavorable executive comment received from the Department of Defense.[89]

[edit] Impeachment proceedings against Dick Cheney



Wikinews has related news: Democrat submits resolution to impeach Cheney




Wikisource has original text related to this article:
US House Resolution 333


On April 17, 2007, Kucinich sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues saying that he planned to file impeachment proceedings against Dick Cheney, then Vice President of the United States.[90] Kucinich planned to introduce the impeachment articles on April 24, 2007, but in light of Cheney's doctor's visit to inspect a blood clot, Kucinich decided to postpone the scheduled press conference "until the vice president's condition is clarified."[91]
Kucinich held a press conference on the evening of April 24, 2007, revealing House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Cheney. He charges Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence, and stated: "I believe the Vice President's conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation. Today, I have introduced House Resolution 333, Articles of Impeachment Relating to Vice President Richard B. Cheney. I do so in defense of the rights of the American people to have a government that is honest and peaceful."[92]
During the first Democratic Presidential debate at South Carolina State University,[93] none of the other candidates' hands went up when the moderator, Brian Williams, asked if they would support Kucinich's plan to impeach Cheney. In response, Kucinich retrieved a pocket-sized copy of the U.S. Constitution from his coat and expressed the importance of protecting and defending constitutional principles.


This is a pocket copy of the Constitution which I carry with me, because I took an oath to defend the Constitution. We've spent a lot of time talking about Iraq here tonight and America's role in the world. This country was taken into war based on lies. This country was taken into war based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and Al Qaeda's role with respect to Iraq, which there wasn't one at the time we went in. I want to state that Mr. Cheney must be held accountable. He is already ginning up a cause for war against Iran. Now, we have to stand for this Constitution, we have to protect and defend this Constitution. And this vice president has violated this Constitution. So I think that while my friends on the stage may not be ready to take this stand, the American people should know that there's at least one person running for president who wants to reconnect America with its goodness, with its greatness, with its highest principles, which currently are not being reflected by those who are in the White House.

—Dennis Kucinich, New York Times, April 27, 2007[94]

As of January 29, 2008, 24 other Congressional representatives have become cosponsors.[95] Six of these are members of the House Judiciary Committee: Tammy Baldwin, Keith Ellison, Hank Johnson, Maxine Waters, Steve Cohen and Sheila Jackson-Lee. In addition, Congressman Robert Wexler, supported by Representatives Luis Gutierrez and Tammy Baldwin, have begun openly calling for impeachment hearings to begin.

[edit] Cheney impeachment articles introduced
On November 6, 2007, Kucinich used special parliamentary procedure and moved for a vote on impeaching the Vice President.[96] The measure was opposed by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Pelosi, who stood by previous comments that, "impeachment is not on our agenda," and they initially moved to table the bill. When that attempt failed, Mr. Hoyer quickly moved to refer the bill to the House Judiciary Committee. That motion succeeded.[96]

[edit] Opposition to H1B/L1 visa programs
Kucinich has been a vocal opponent of the H1B and L1 visa programs. In an article on his campaign website, he states:[97]


The expanded use of H-1B and L-1 visas has had a negative effect on the workplace of Information Technology workers in America. It has caused a reduction in wages. It has forced workers to accept deteriorating working conditions and allowed U.S. companies to concentrate work in technical and geographic areas that American workers consider undesirable. It has also reduced the number of IT jobs held by Americans.



[edit] Plan to ban handguns
In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre in Blacksburg, Virginia, Kucinich proposed a plan that he says will address violence in America. Kucinich is currently drafting legislation that includes a ban on the purchase, sale, transfer, or possession of handguns by civilians.[98]
The congressman has pushed for gun control, even as a city councilman. He did carry a handgun for a period of time in 1978 (under the recommendation of the police) when he was the target of a Mafia plot.[99]

[edit] Support for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine
Kucinich is also involved in efforts to bring back the Fairness Doctrine, requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he and other critics of talk radio claim is not presently the case. He is joined in this effort by fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, among others, as well as Vermont's independent Senator Bernie Sanders.[100] Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.[101][102][103]

[edit] Animal Rights
Kucinich addresses the issue of factory farming in his policy encouraging independent, family-owned, and organic farming. This would help lead to "the meat that we consume coming from happy and healthy free-range animals," Kucinich states on his campaign website.[104]
Kucinich is one of the few vegans in Congress.[2] He has maintained a diet for many years that excludes animal products in accordance with his conviction that "all life on our Earth [is] sacred."[104][105]

[edit] Free Market Drug Act
Kucinich believes that the prices for patented drugs are unreasonably high, and that patent monopolies have created a restricted, unfree drug market. "Simply put, if drug manufacturers were operating in a free market like most other businesses in the US, drug prices would be significantly lower." On September 29, 2004, he introduced H.R. 5155, the Free Market Drug Act; a system where the National Institutes of Health would fund research, thus disconnecting the manufacturing of drugs from research and increasing competition among private manufacturers. [106]

[edit] Energy policy
As mayor of Cleveland in the 1970s, Kucinich saved the city's Municipal Light System and opposed construction of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant and Perry Nuclear Power Plant on Lake Erie. Kucinich also helped Ohioans defeat a planned regional radioactive waste dump, and has long advocated renewable energy and efficient energy use.[107]

[edit] Bush Impeachment Articles Introduced
See also: Movement to impeach George W. Bush
On June 9, 2008, Kucinich gave notice of his intention to introduce 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush on the floor of the House of Representatives.[108][109] video

He officially offered his resolution the next day and the Clerk spent just under four hours reading the resolution into the House record. After the Clerk had finished reading the resolution, Kucinich moved to refer the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee; the House voted on June 11 to refer the resolution.
Calling it "a sworn duty" of Congress to act, Robert Wexler co-sponsored and signed, on June 10, 2008, Kucinich's Articles of impeachment for President Bush, and stated: "President Bush deliberately created a massive propaganda campaign to sell the war in Iraq to the American people and the charges detailed in this impeachment resolution indicate an unprecedented abuse of executive power."[110] Democratic leaders Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi opposed it and she announced that “she would not support a resolution calling for Bush's impeachment, saying such a move was unlikely to succeed and would be divisive.”
On June 20, former Bush press secretary Scott McClellan testified before the House Judiciary Committee about his experiences in the administration leading up to the war.[111]
On July 10, 2008, Kucinich introduced one article of impeachment against President George W. Bush for misleading Congress into war. [112][113][114]
On July 14, 2008 Kucinich introduced a new resolution of impeachment against George W. Bush with only one count. Kucinich charged Bush of manufacturing evidence to sway public opinion in favor of the war in Iraq. Speaker Pelosi said in a CBS interview on July 14 that this resolution of impeachment should be looked at more closely. On July 15 the resolution was sent to the judiciary committee. According the associated press the judiciary committee is expected to hold at least one hearing on the issue and will hear testimony from Washington insiders, and experts.
