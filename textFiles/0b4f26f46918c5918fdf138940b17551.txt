[edit] Introduction
A card-based transaction typically travels from a transaction acquiring device, such as a point-of-sale terminal or an ATM, through a series of networks, to a card issuing system for authorization against the card holder's account. The transaction data contains information derived from the card (e.g., the account number), the terminal (e.g., the merchant number), the transaction (e.g., the amount), together with other data which may be generated dynamically or added by intervening systems. The card issuing system will either authorize or decline the transaction and generate a response message which must be delivered back to the terminal in a timely manner.
ISO 8583 defines a message format and a communication flow so that different systems can exchange these transactions. The vast majority of transactions made at Automated Teller Machines use ISO 8583 at some point in the communication chain, as do transactions made when a customer uses a card to make a payment in a store. In particular, both the MasterCard and Visa networks base their authorization communications on the ISO 8583 standard, as do many other institutions and networks.
Cardholder-originated transactions include purchase, withdrawal, deposit, refund, reversal, balance inquiry, payments and inter-account transfers. ISO 8583 also defines system-to-system messages for secure key exchanges, reconciliation of totals, and other administrative purposes.
Although ISO 8583 defines a common standard, it is not typically used directly by systems or networks. Instead, each network adapts the standard for its own use with custom fields and custom usages.
The placement of fields in different versions of the standard varies; for example, the currency elements of the 1987 and 1993 versions are no longer used in the 2003 version, which holds currency as a sub-element of any financial amount element. As of writing, ISO 8583:2003 has yet to achieve wide acceptance.
An ISO 8583 message is made of the following parts:

Message Type Indicator (MTI)
One or more bitmaps, indicating which data elements are present
Data elements, the fields of the message


[edit] Message Type Indicator (MTI)
This is a 4 digit numeric field which classifies the high level function of the message. A Message Type Indicator includes the ISO 8583 version, the Message Class, the Message Function and the Message Origin, each described briefly in the following sections.
example :

[edit] 0110

  0xxx -> version of ISO 8583 (1987 version)
  x1xx -> class of the Message (Authorization Message)
  xx1x -> function of the Message (Request Response)
  xxx0 -> who began the communication (Acquirer)




[edit] ISO 8583 Version
Position one of the MTI specifies the versions of the ISO 8583 standard which is being used to transmit the message.


Position
Meaning


0xxx
ISO 8583-1:1987 version


1xxx
ISO 8583-2:1993 version


2xxx
ISO 8583-1:2003 version


9xxx
Private usage



[edit] Message Class
Position two of the MTI specifies the overall purpose of the message.


Position
Meaning
Usage


x1xx
Authorization Message
Determine if funds are available, get an approval but do not post to account for reconciliation, Dual Message System (DMS), awaits file exchange for posting to account


x2xx
Financial Message
Determines if funds are available, get an approval and post directly to the account, Single Message System (SMS), no file exchange after this


x3xx
File Actions Message
Used for hot-card, TMS and other exchanges


x4xx
Reversal Message
Reverses the action of a previous authorization


x5xx
Reconciliation Message
Transmits settlement information


x6xx
Administrative Message
Transmits administrative advice. Often used for failure messages (e.g. message reject or failure to apply)


x7xx
Fee Collection Message



x8xx
Network Management Message
Used for secure key exchange, logon, echo test and other network functions


x9xx
Reserved by ISO



[edit] Message Function
Position three of the MTI specifies the message function which defines how the message should flow within the system. Requests are end-to-end messages (e.g., from acquirer to issuer and back with timeouts and automatic reversals in place), while advices are point-to-point messages (eg, from terminal to acquirer, from acquirer to network, from network to issuer, with transmission guaranteed over each link, but not necessarily immediately).


Position
Meaning


xx0x
Request


xx1x
Request Response


xx2x
Advice


xx3x
Advice Response


xx4x
Notification


xx8x
Response acknowledgment


xx9x
Negative acknowledgment



[edit] Message Origin
Position four of the MTI defines the location of the message source within the payment chain.


Position
Meaning


xxx0
Acquirer


xxx1
Acquirer Repeat


xxx2
Issuer


xxx3
Issuer Repeat


xxx4
Other


xxx5
Other Repeat



[edit] Examples
Bearing each of the above four positions in mind, an MTI will completely specify what a message should do, and how it is to be transmitted around the network. Unfortunately, not all ISO 8583 implementations interpret the meaning of an MTI in the same way. However, a few MTIs are relatively standard:


MTI
Meaning
Usage


0100
Authorization request
Request from a point-of-sale terminal for authorization for a cardholder purchase


0120
Authorization Advice
When the Point of Sale device breaks down and you have to sign a voucher


0121
Authorisation Advice Repeat
if the advice times out


0200
Acquirer Financial Request
Request for funds, typically from an ATM


0220
Acquirer Financial Advice
e.g. Checkout at a hotel


0221
Acquirer Financial Advice repeat
if the advice times out


0400
Acquirer Reversal Request
Reverses a transaction


0420
Acquirer Reversal Advice
Advises that a reversal has taken place


0421
Acquirer Reversal Advice Repeat Message
if the reversal times out


0800
Network Management Request
Echo test, logon, log off etc


0820
Network Management Advice
Keychange



[edit] Bitmaps
Within ISO 8583, a bitmap is a field or subfield within a message which indicates which other data elements or data element subfields may be present elsewhere in a message.
A message will contain at least one bitmap, called the Primary Bitmap which indicates which of Data Elements 1 to 64 are present. A secondary bitmap may also be present, generally as data element one and indicates which of data elements 65 to 128 are present. Similarly, a tertiary, or third, bitmap can be used to indicate the presence or absence of fields 129 to 192, although these data elements are rarely used.
The bitmap may be transmitted as 8 bytes of binary data, or as 16 hexadecimal characters 0-9, A-F in the ASCII or EBCDIC character sets.
A field is present when the specific bit in the bitmap is true, i.e. byte '82x is binary '1000 0010' which means fields 1 and 7 are present in the message

Fields present in variable length message record:
2-7-12-28-32-39-41-42-50-53-62

[edit] Data Elements
Data Elements are the individual fields carrying the transaction information. There are up to 128 data elements specified in the original ISO 8583:1987 standard, and up to 192 data elements in later releases. The 1993 revision added new definitions, deleted some, while leaving the message format itself unchanged.
While each data element has a specified meaning and format, the standard also includes some general purpose data elements and system- or country-specific data elements which vary enormously in use and form from implementation to implementation.
Each data element is described in a standard format which defines the permitted content of the field (numeric, binary, etc) and the field length (variable or fixed), according to the following table:


Abbreviation
Meaning


a
Alpha, including blanks


n
Numeric values only


s
Special characters only


an
Alphanumeric


as
Alpha & special characters only


ns
Numeric and special characters only


ans
Alphabetic, numeric and special characters.


b
Binary data


z
Tracks 2 and 3 code set as defined in ISO 4909 and ISO/IEC 7813


. or .. or ...
variable field length indicator, each . indicating a digit.


x or xx or xxx
fixed length of field or maximum length in the case of variable length fields.


Additionally, each field may be either fixed or variable length. If variable, the length of the field will be preceded by a length indicator.


Type
Meaning


Fixed
no field length used


LLVAR or (..xx)
Where LL < 100, means two leading digits LL specify the field length of field VAR


LLLVAR or (...xxx)
Where LLL < 1000, means three leading digits LLL specify the field length of field VAR


LL and LLL are hex or ASCII. A VAR field can be compressed or ASCII depending of the data element type.
LL can be 1 or 2 bytes. For example, if compressed as one hex byte, '27x means there are 27 VAR bytes to follow. If ASCII, the two bytes '32x, '37x mean there are 27 bytes to follow. 3 digit field length LLL uses 2 bytes with a leading '0' nibble if compressed, or 3 bytes if ASCII. The format of a VAR data element depends on the data element type. If numeric it will be compressed, e.g. 87456 will be represented by 3 hex bytes '087456x. If ASCII then one byte for each digit or character is used, e.g. '38x, '37x, '34x, '35x, '36x.
