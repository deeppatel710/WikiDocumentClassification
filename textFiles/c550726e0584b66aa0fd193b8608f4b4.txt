List of ports redirects here, for a list of sea ports for ships see List of Seaports.
In computer networking, the protocols of the Transport Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, most notably the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), but also other protocols, use a numerical identifier for the data structures of the endpoints for host-to-host communications. Such an endpoint is known as a port and the identifier is the port number. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for maintaining the official assignments of port numbers for specific uses.[1]

[edit] Ranges
The port numbers are divided into three ranges:

The Well Known Ports are those in the range 0–1023. On Unix-like operating systems, binding a communications socket to a port in this range requires administrative privileges or possessing CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability[2].
The Registered Ports are those in the range 1024–49151.
The Dynamic and/or Private Ports are those in the range 49152–65535. Randomly chosen port numbers out of this range are called ephemeral ports. These ports are not permanently assigned to any publicly defined application.

IANA does not enforce adherence in use of port numbers to these assignments; it is simply a set of recommended uses. Sometimes applications use port numbers for different purposes than the official assignments suggest. This misuse may be, for example, by malicious software (e.g. Trojan horse) to intercept unsecured traffic or simply because no unique port exists for the application.

[edit] Registered ports: 1024–49151
Only those ports that are commonly used are listed; for full list, refer to the IANA port list.[1]
When investigating TCP traffic, be careful not to confuse the client and server ports. The client port is incremental, typically beginning at 1024 at boot time and wrapping at 4096. If the port you are investigating is in the lower part of this range, it may be a client port. Stateful firewalls identify the server port, but packet sniffers and stateless firewalls do not. For example, a packet sniffer showing a TCP packet with source port 1080 and destination port 1494 might be either the SOCKetS or Citrix Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocols. The only way to know for sure is to examine the initial TCP handshake.
With UDP, client port selection depends on the application and may be incremental, fixed to a nonsensical value, or fixed equal to the server port.

[edit] Dynamic and/or private ports: 49152–65535
By definition, no ports can be registered in the dynamic range.[1]
Many Linux kernels and/or distros assign ephemeral ports from the range 32768 to 61000 by default. /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range contains the current range.
