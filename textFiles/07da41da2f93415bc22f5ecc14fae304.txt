Second normal form (2NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. 2NF was originally defined by E.F. Codd[1] in 1971. A table that is in first normal form (1NF) must meet additional criteria if it is to qualify for second normal form. Specifically: a 1NF table is in 2NF if and only if, given any candidate key and any attribute that is not a constituent of a candidate key, the non-key attribute depends upon the whole of the candidate key rather than just a part of it.
In slightly more formal terms: a 1NF table is in 2NF if and only if none of its non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on a part (proper subset) of a candidate key. (A non-prime attribute is one that does not belong to any candidate key.)
Note that when a 1NF table has no composite candidate keys (candidate keys consisting of more than one attribute), the table is automatically in 2NF.

[edit] Example
Consider a table describing employees' skills:

Employees' Skills

Employee
Skill
Current Work Location


Jones
Typing
114 Main Street


Jones
Shorthand
114 Main Street


Jones
Whittling
114 Main Street


Roberts
Light Cleaning
73 Industrial Way


Ellis
Alchemy
73 Industrial Way


Ellis
Juggling
73 Industrial Way


Harrison
Light Cleaning
73 Industrial Way


Neither {Employee} nor {Skill} is a candidate key for the table. This is because a given Employee might need to appear more than once (he might have multiple Skills), and a given Skill might need to appear more than once (it might be possessed by multiple Employees). Only the composite key {Employee, Skill} qualifies as a candidate key for the table.
The remaining attribute, Current Work Location, is dependent on only part of the candidate key, namely Employee. Therefore the table is not in 2NF. Note the redundancy in the way Current Work Locations are represented: we are told three times that Jones works at 114 Main Street, and twice that Ellis works at 73 Industrial Way. This redundancy makes the table vulnerable to update anomalies: it is, for example, possible to update Jones' work location on his "Typing" and "Shorthand" records and not update his "Whittling" record. The resulting data would imply contradictory answers to the question "What is Jones' current work location?"
A 2NF alternative to this design would represent the same information in two tables: an "Employees" table with candidate key {Employee}, and an "Employees' Skills" table with candidate key {Employee, Skill}:




Employees

Employee
Current Work Location


Jones
114 Main Street


Roberts
73 Industrial Way


Ellis
73 Industrial Way


Harrison
73 Industrial Way





Employees' Skills

Employee
Skill


Jones
Typing


Jones
Shorthand


Jones
Whittling


Roberts
Light Cleaning


Ellis
Alchemy


Ellis
Juggling


Harrison
Light Cleaning





Neither of these tables can suffer from update anomalies.
Not all 2NF tables are free from update anomalies, however. An example of a 2NF table which suffers from update anomalies is:

Tournament Winners

Tournament
Year
Winner
Winner Date of Birth


Des Moines Masters
1998
Chip Masterson
14 March 1977


Indiana Invitational
1998
Al Fredrickson
21 July 1975


Cleveland Open
1999
Bob Albertson
28 September 1968


Des Moines Masters
1999
Al Fredrickson
21 July 1975


Indiana Invitational
1999
Chip Masterson
14 March 1977


Even though Winner and Winner Date of Birth are determined by the whole key {Tournament, Year} and not part of it, particular Winner / Winner Date of Birth combinations are shown redundantly on multiple records. This problem is addressed by third normal form (3NF).

[edit] 2NF and candidate keys
A table for which there are no partial functional dependencies on the primary key is typically, but not always, in 2NF. In addition to the primary key, the table may contain other candidate keys; it is necessary to establish that no non-prime attributes have part-key dependencies on any of these candidate keys.
Multiple candidate keys occur in the following table:

Electric Toothbrush Models

Manufacturer
Model
Model Full Name
Manufacturer Country


Forte
X-Prime
Forte X-Prime
Italy


Forte
Ultraclean
Forte Ultraclean
Italy


Dent-o-Fresh
EZbrush
Dent-o-Fresh EZBrush
USA


Kobayashi
ST-60
Kobayashi ST-60
Japan


Hoch
Toothmaster
Hoch Toothmaster
Germany


Hoch
Contender
Hoch Contender
Germany


Even if the designer has specified the primary key as {Model Full Name}, the table is not in 2NF. {Manufacturer, Model} is also a candidate key, and Manufacturer Country is dependent on a proper subset of it: Manufacturer.
