SubStation Alpha

Filename extension
.ssa, .ass


Developed by
Kotus


SubStation Alpha (or Sub Station Alpha), abbreviated SSA, is a subtitle file format created by Kotus (the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland) that allows for more advanced subtitles than the conventional SRT and similar formats. This format can be rendered with VSFilter in conjunction with a DirectShow-aware video player (on Microsoft Windows), or MPlayer with the SSA/ASS library. It is also the name of the popular, now discontinued tool used to edit subtitles.
This subtitle format is frequently used in anime fansubs, either to overlay subtitles onto video while it is being encoded (hardsubbing), or to store subtitle data alongside video data in a Matroska (MKV) container (softsubbing). Hardsubbing is irreversible but does not require VSFilter or other special resources for playback. Softsubbing allows the end user to choose whether subtitles will be displayed, and makes it possible to include multiple subtitle streams in the same video file.
The current version of SSA is v4.00.
There are many freeware and open source subtitling applications that support the SSA format.

[edit] Explanation

Script Info: general information about the script:

Title
Original Script
Script Updated By
Script Type (useful for compatibility)
Collisions (determines the stacking direction of the subtitles when two or more are present with no specific position: if Normal, subtitles are stacked from down to up; if Reverse, they're stacked from up to down, and can leave spaces under them)
PlayResX & PlayResY (useful for graphics and subtitle positioning. If only one present, the other is calculated with real video proportions)
PlayDepth (determines number of colors)
Timer (all timing is multiplied by this percentage, always written with decimal point and four decimal signs. If smaller than 100.0000, subtitles appear faster and sooner than specified. If greater, slower and later)


V4 Styles: a "Format:" line, that specifies the meaning of the "Style:" line Fields, and one or plus "Style" lines, specifying the color, position, margins, the "shape" of a normal subtitle when adjusted to a determinated style (see "Events" section below). All boolean options are written as 0 or 1 (0=false, 1=true). Strange features are:

PrimaryColour. Subtitle filling color
SecondaryColour. If subtitle has karaoke commands, will appear in this color, changing to PrimaryColour.
TertiaryColour (OutlineColour in ASS). Border color
BackColour. Shadow color
MarginL, MarginR. Minimum margins from subtitles to video limits.
MarginV. Minimum margin from subtitles to a video limit, that changes with alignment: if the video limit is the top, distances are from video top; if bottom, distances are from video bottom; if centered, this is unused. In all margin parameters, line is normally cut in \n & \N commands and in spaces, when necessary. An optional parameter in Script Info (only available in ASS), WrapStyle, can change this.
Outline. Subtitle can be defined with a border, a rectangle or nothing.
Shadow. Distance from shadow to subtitle.
AlphaLevel. Transparency (0 is null, 255 is total)
Encoding. Useful for writing other alphabet characters in ASCII. With Latin characters, this is set to zero. With Japanese characters, it can be set to 128 (ex: ‹ó displays Sora kanji). With Hebrew characters, it can be set to 177.


Events: the section with the subtitles. Timing and text are here, and it's also able to put special effects and style modifications, with commands with the same syntax: {\letters invoking command(parameters separated by comma)}, like in {\move(80,80,200,200,150,300)}. Strange parameters:

Marked. Unused.
Effect. There are three available effects for text appearing, all of them substitutable for commands and others.



If there is only a parameter, brackets are not needed (ex. {\kf89}).
Two exceptions:

Inside braces can be more than one command. Ex. {\bord8\be1}
\N and \n commands don't use braces.


[edit] Advanced SubStation Alpha
Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) is a script for more advanced subtitles than SSA. It is technically SSA v4+. It is able to produce anything from simple texts to manual graphic editing used in karaoke. There are few programs designed to create these scripts. The main feature of ASS is it has more specifications than normal SSA, like in styles programming. For example, the above script changed into ASS:

[edit] Subtitling programs that support the SSA format

Aegisub - Free and open source software. A relatively new editor, focused mostly on typesetting. It works in Windows NT, 2000, XP and Vista, and with limited functionality on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. Since it has the most extensive and comprehensive manual (which includes tutorials on working with the subtitle format), it also appeals to new users. UTF-8 is properly supported, but beware that not all programs accepting ASS/SSA files can read UTF-8. Unlike SubStation Alpha, it has a video bar and not just an audio bar for presentation of the video clip.
VisualSubSync - Freeware subtitling tool with SRT/SSA/ASS support for Windows.
subtitleeditor - A tool to edit subtitles for GNU/Linux. (ASS, SSA, SubRip, MicroDVD, MPL2, MPsub, SubViewer 2.0, plain-text, and Adobe Encore DVD formats)
Sabbu - Free and open source software, hosted at SourceForge. An advanced SSA/ASS editor, focused mostly on timing. It runs in Windows and Linux. This program is a suitable replacement for the original Substation Alpha, as it is basically a more modern version of it. No longer developed.
Sub Station Alpha tool - Freeware, the original tool, which is very outdated and no longer developed, but still a favorite of some.
Subtitle Workshop - Freeware. It is not advised because it is not a fully dedicated SSA/ASS editor, because it doesn't follow the strict rules about SSA subtitles, and it erases any style put in with another program. However, unlike SubStation Alpha it has a video bar instead of an audio bar for presentation of the video clip.
Subtitle Processor - Free and open source software, hosted at SourceForge. It is feature rich general subtitle editor with good SSA/ASS support. Unicode is supported from version 7.7, UTF-8 is preferred, other encodings are internally converted to UTF-8. Requires 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP).
Miyu Freeware with free pro plugins for Mac OS X. Also supports .srt (SubRip) and .edl formats.


[edit] Applications that can read and render SSA subtitles

VLC Media Player, open source software; for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, BeOS and Syllable.
MPlayer, open source; runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, BeOS, Syllable, AmigaOS and MorphOS.
Combined-Community-Codec-Pack - open source; is a DirectShow set of codecs provided with third party players. Once installed, it allows Window Media Player to display SSA subtitles.
