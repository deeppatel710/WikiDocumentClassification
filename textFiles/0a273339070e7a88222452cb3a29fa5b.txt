Secret society is a term used to describe a variety of organizations. Although the exact meaning of the term is disputed, several of the definitions advanced indicate a degree of secrecy and secret knowledge, which might include denying membership or knowledge of the group, negative consequences for acknowledging one's membership, strong ties between members of the organization, and rites or rituals which outsiders are not permitted to observe.

[edit] Definition
Several definitions for the term have been put forward. The term "secret society" is used to describe fraternal organizations that may have secret ceremonies, ranging from the common and innocuous (collegiate fraternities) to mythical organizations described in conspiracy theories as immensely powerful, with self-serving financial or political agendas, global reach, and often luciferian beliefs.
Application of the term is often hotly disputed, as it can be seen as pejorative.
Therefore, the criteria that can be adopted as a definition for the term are important for which organizations any one definition would include or exclude.[citation needed]
Alan Axelrod, author of the International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders, defines a secret society where:

The organization is exclusive
It claims to own special secrets
It shows a strong inclination to favor its own

David V. Barrett, author of Secret Societies: From the Ancient and Arcane to the Modern and Clandestine, uses slightly different terms to define what does and does not qualify as a secret society. He defines it as any group that possesses the following characteristics:

It has "carefully graded and progressed teachings"
Teachings are "available only to selected individuals"
Teachings lead to "hidden (and 'unique') truths"
Truths bring "personal benefits beyond the reach and even the understanding of the uninitiated."

Barrett goes on to say that "a further characteristic common to most of them is the practice of rituals which non-members are not permitted to observe, or even to know the existence of." Unfortunately, Barrett's definition would rule out many organizations called secret societies; (American college fraternities do not have graded teachings, nor did groups like the Carbonari, the Know Nothing Whigs or any of the political secret societies). Indeed any author can construct a definition so that it includes or excludes a specific group.

[edit] Oath taking
Many societies require members to take an oath at membership. Parts of an oath can include a promise to support the organization, to keep its secrets, that the new member will conceal or deny their membership in the organization. Sometimes such oaths can include penalties (ranging from the purely symbolic to the very real) for not living up to the oath.

[edit] Politics
Since some secret societies have political aims, they are illegal in several countries. Poland, for example, has included a ban of secret political parties and political organizations in its constitution. Not all secret societies are perceived as a threat by the existing political establishment.

[edit] Colleges and universities
Many student societies established on university campuses in the United States have been considered secret societies. These such collegiate secret societies are like the F.H.C. Club, (1750), and Phi Beta Kappa, (1776), both founded at William & Mary. The most famous member of the F.H.C. Club was Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States. In correspondence, Jefferson noted that the F.H.C. Club served "no useful object." Perhaps one of the most famous secret college societies is the Skull and Bones at Yale, of which both presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry are members from their college years.

[edit] Groups disputed as "secret societies"
The term "secret societies" could include criminal organizations, such as the Triad, Yakuza or the Cosa Nostra organizations.
The United States of America's National Security Agency has been described as a secret society since for many years, its very existence was a secret, as was its budget. People (such as James Bamford, in The Puzzle Palace, 1982) used to say that the letters NSA stood for "No Such Agency" or "Never Say Anything"; and, in the early 1990s, the CIA had a website but the NSA did not. This has changed: The NSA has had a website for several years, and its activities are debated in Congress and the press. Its budget is still classified, but it officially exists. Its activities are authorized and are paid for, although the details of those activities are closely-held secrets.
