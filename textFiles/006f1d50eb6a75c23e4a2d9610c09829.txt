Holophonics is a trademark for a specific form of sound recording that is based on the (unproven) hypothesis that the auditory system acts as an interferometer. The sound characteristics of Holophonics are most clearly heard through headphones, though can be demonstrated to be effective with ordinary 2 channel stereo speakers. To optimize this effect, loudspeakers have also been specifically designed for reproducing Holophonic recordings.
There has been some controversy over the claims made by Zucharelli regarding this recording technique. The effects achieved are comparable to traditional binaural recording using mannequin heads, or via more traditional 3D audio techniques via HRTF's. There is no evidence nor studies conducted that indicate that the Holophonic technique is substantially different from or superior to these methods, nor has Zucharelli ever published his technique, nor has he allowed independent study of the results.
While otoacoustic emissions do exist, there is no evidence to support his assertion that these play a role in sound localization, nor is any mechanism for this "interference" effect claimed by Zucharelli supported. On the contrary, there is abundant literature proving that properly presented spatial cues via HRTF synthesis (mimicing binaural heads) or binaural recording is adequate to reproduce realistic spatial recordings comparable to real listening.[1]

[edit] History
Holophonics was created by Argentine Hugo Zuccarelli in 1980, during his studies at the Polytechnic of Milan, Italy. It, along with Zuccarelli, rose to fame in 1983 with the release of a recording entitled Zuccarelli Holophonics (The Matchbox Shaker) released in the UK by CBS which consisted entirely of short recordings of sound effects designed to show off the system. These included the shaking matchbox, haircut & blower, bees, balloon, plastic bag, birds, airplanes, fireworks, thunder, and racing cars. In its early years, Holophonics was used by various artists including Michael Jackson, who used Holophonics on his album "Bad", Paul McCartney, and Richard Branson. It has been used in film soundtrack, popular music, television and themeparks.[2]
Zuccarelli states that the human auditory system is a sound emitter, producing a reference sound that combines with incoming sound to form an interference pattern inside the ear. The nature of this pattern is sensitive to the direction of the incoming sound. According to the hypothesis, the cochlea detects and analyzes this pattern as if it were an acoustic hologram. The brain then interprets this data and infers the direction of the sound. An article from Zuccarelli presenting this theory was printed in the magazine New Scientist in 1983. This article was followed soon after by two letters casting doubt on Zuccarelli's theory and his scientific abilities.[3][4]
Holophonics, like binaural recording, reproduces the interaural differences (arrival time and amplitude between the ears), as well as rudimentary head-related transfer functions (HRTF). These create the illusion that sounds produced in the membrane of a speaker emanate from specific directions. To produce digital holophonic or binaural recordings, a mono source requires many HRTF channels combined.[citation needed].

[edit] Examples of holophonic sound

Holophonics Sound Samples:
From holophonic.ch: — An example of holophonics: you hear someone lighting two matches, first on your right and then your left. You then hear the box of matches shaking all around your head. Listen with headphones. It appears that Zuccarelli and Maggi have worked together in Italy in the '80s. Another example from holophonic.ch is the sensual voice of a woman whispering into your ears going from the left to right.
