He grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana where he acted and won a state championship in debate. He went to college at New College, now New College of Florida, in Sarasota, Florida. His career path has included jobs as a magician, waiter, karate teacher, landscaper, vitamin distributor, glass-blowing lathe operator, travel agent, gas station manager, U-Haul dealer, moped salesman, restaurant cook,[1] personal growth trainer, manager of a lawn service company, and manager of a travel agency. He is also an ordained minister with the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness.[2][3] He claims to have had 35 professions before age 35.[4] He began applying his perspective on productivity with businesses in the 1980s when he got a contract to design a program for executives and managers at Lockheed.
He is the founder of the David Allen Company, which is focused on productivity and executive coaching. The Getting Things Done method is part of his coaching efforts. He was also one of the founders of Actioneer, Inc., a company specializing in productivity tools for the Palm Pilot.
Allen has written three books, Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, which describes his productivity program and Ready for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Work and Life, a collection of newsletter articles he has written. His third book is Making It All Work: Winning at the Game of Work and Business of Life which is a follow-up to his first book. He lives in Ojai, California with his fourth wife, Kathryn.[1]
