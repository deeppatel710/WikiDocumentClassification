From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
Nazi UFOs (German: Rundflugzeug, Diskus, Haunebu, Hauneburg-Geräte, VRIL, Andromeda-Geräte, Flugkreisel or ironically Reichsflugscheiben) refers to claims about advanced aircraft or spacecraft Nazi Germany supposedly developed during World War II and which Nazi scientists continued to develop afterwards. References to such craft appear mostly in fiction and conspiracy theory sources.
These stories are often associated with esoteric Nazism, an ideology that supposes the possibility of Nazi restoration by supernatural or paranormal means.[1]
These myths were likely inspired by historical German development of jet aircraft such as the Me 262, the Horten Ho 229, the guided missile V1 and the ballistic missile V2, the latter forming the basis for the early missile and space programs of both the Soviet Union and the United States.

[edit] Context
Nazi UFO tales and myths conform largely to documented history on the following points:

Nazi Germany claimed the territory of New Swabia in Antarctica, sent an expedition there in 1938, and planned others.[citation needed]
Nazi Germany conducted research into advanced propulsion technology, including rocketry, Viktor Schauberger's turbine research[citation needed], and the Arthur Sack A.S.6 experimental "flying disc".
Some UFO sightings during World War II, particularly those known as foo fighters, were thought to be enemy aircraft.


[edit] Early claims
The earliest non-fiction assertions of Nazi flying saucers appears to have been an article which appeared in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia in early 1950. Written by Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo, an Italian scientist and a former Italian Minister of National Economy under the Mussolini regime, it claimed that "types of flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942". Belluzzo also expressed the opinion that "some great power is launching discs to study them".[2]
The same month, German engineer Rudolf Schriever gave an interview to German news magazine Der Spiegel in which he claimed that he had designed a craft powered by a circular plane of rotating turbine blades, 49 ft (15 m) in diameter. He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at BMW's Prague works until April 1945, when he fled Czechoslovakia. His designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his craft for "a foreign power".[3]
In 1953, when Avro Canada announced that it was developing the VZ-9-AV Avrocar, a circular jet aircraft with an estimated speed of 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), German engineer Georg Klein claimed that such designs had been developed during the Third Reich. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:

A non-rotating disk developed at Breslau by V-2 rocket engineer Richard Miethe, which was captured by the Soviets, while Miethe fled to the US via France, and ended up working for Avro.
A disk developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl at Prague, which consisted of a ring of moving turbine blades around a fixed cockpit. Klein claimed that he had witnessed this craft's first manned flight on 14 February 1945, when it managed to climb to 12,400 m (41,000 ft) in 3 minutes and attained a speed of 2,200 km/h (1,400 mph) in level flight.

Aeronautical engineer Roy Fedden remarked that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war. Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945:


“
I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realise that if they (the Germans) had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.[4]
”


Fedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.[5]
In 1959, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, editor of the U.S.A.F.'s Project Blue Book wrote:


“
When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported to UFO observers.[6]
”



[edit] Later claims

[edit] Morning of the Magicians
Main article: Le Matin des Magiciens
Le Matin des Magiciens, a 1967 book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, made many spectacular claims about the Vril Society of Berlin.[7] Several later writers, including Jan van Helsing,[8][9] Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer,[10] and Vladimir Terziski, have built on their work, connecting the Vril Society with UFOs. Among their claims, they write that the society had made contact with an alien race and dedicated itself to creating spacecraft to reach the aliens. In partnership with the Thule Society and the Nazi Party, it developed a series of flying disc prototypes. With the Nazi defeat, the society allegedly retreated to a base in Antarctica and vanished.
Terziski, a Bulgarian engineer who bills himself as president of the American Academy of Dissident Sciences, claims that the Germans collaborated in their advanced craft research with Axis powers Italy and Japan, and continued their space effort after the war from New Swabia. He writes that Germans landed on the Moon as early as 1942 and established an underground base there. When Russians and Americans secretly landed on the moon in the 1950s, says Terziski, they stayed at this still-operating base. According to Terziski, "there is atmosphere, water and vegetation on the Moon," which NASA conceals to exclude the third world from moon exploration. Terziski has been accused of fabricating his video and photographic evidence.[11]

[edit] Ernst Zündel's marketing ploy
Main article: Zündel: Nazi UFOs-Antarctica
When German Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel started Samisdat Publishers in the 1970s, he initially catered to the UFOlogy community, which was then at its peak of public acceptance. His main offerings were his own books claiming that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, from which the Nazis hoped to conquer the world.[12] Zündel also sold (for $9999) seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth.[13] Some who interviewed Zündel claim that he privately admitted it was a deliberate hoax to build publicity for Samisdat, although he still defended it as late as 2002.[14][15]

[edit] Miguel Serrano's book
In 1978 Miguel Serrano, a Chilean diplomat and Nazi sympathizer, published The Golden Band, in which he claimed that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of Vishnu and was then communing with Hyperborean gods in an underground Antarctic base. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the Fourth Reich.[16]
