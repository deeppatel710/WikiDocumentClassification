Banshee can play, import, and burn audio CDs, and supports many portable media players, including Apple's iPod, T-Mobile G1 and Creative's ZEN players, in the current version.[2] Music stored on the iPod can be played without synchronization, and album art stored in the Banshee library is transferred to the iPod. Support for MTP and PlaysForSure devices, as well as the Rio Karma player is planned for the near future.

[edit] Plugins
Using a plugin-capable architecture, Banshee is highly extensible and customizable. Current stable plugins include:





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this section to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (November 2008)



Audioscrobbler: Adds the capability of reporting played songs to a user's Last.fm playlist, and play last.fm radio stations (user's library, tags, similar to, etc.).
DAAP music sharing: Allows sharing of music libraries with iTunes and other DAAP-compatible music software. The current version of Banshee is only partially compatible with iTunes 7, allowing iTunes to open a Banshee library, but not vice-versa.
iPod manager: Allows the transferring of songs, videos, and album art to and from the device.
Metadata searcher using Musicbrainz: Automatically retrieves missing and supplementary metadata for library items, including album art.
Music Recommendations using Last.fm: Recommends music based on the currently playing song.
Mini-Mode plugin: Provides a small window with minimal playback controls and song information.
Multimedia keys support in GNOME: Banshee can be controlled via multimedia keys as configured through GNOME.
Notification Area Icon: Adds an icon to the notification area in GNOME.
Podcasting: Enables Banshee to subscribe to podcast feeds, which are updated on a regular basis. There is also a "Find new podcasts" feature which utilises Podcast Alley.
Radio: Provides support for streaming internet radio stations.


[edit] Helix Banshee
Helix Banshee is a version of Banshee, included in SLED and available in openSUSE (non-OSS media). It is based upon the Banshee core, but adds support for the Helix framework for playback and transcoding, in addition to GStreamer. Helix Banshee does not modify the core of Banshee in any way, it simply builds upon it via Banshee's extensible plugin framework.
