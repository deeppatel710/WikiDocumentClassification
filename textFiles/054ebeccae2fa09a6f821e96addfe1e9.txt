[edit] Influence on society
Software engineers affect society by creating applications. These applications produce value for users, and sometimes produce disasters.

[edit] Applications
Software engineers build software (applications, operating systems, system software) that people use.
Applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways. For example, consumer software emphasizes low cost, medical software emphasizes high quality, and Internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development.

Engineering All traditional engineering branches use software extensively. Engineers use spreadsheets, more than they ever used calculators. Engineers use custom software tools to design, analyze, and simulate their own projects, like bridges and power lines. These projects resemble software in many respects, because the work exists as electronic documents and goes through analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. Software tools for engineers use the tenets of computer science; as well as the tenets of calculus, physics, and chemistry.

[edit] Disasters
Software has played a role in many high-profile disasters.

Ariane 5 Flight 501
Mars probe
Denver International Airport
TAURUS — UK share settlement system and dematerialised central share depository.
Therac-25 — A radiation therapy machine responsible for six overdoses due to faulty software.
Airbus A320 —[citation needed] The Airbus A320, while was controversial in software engineering circles, being the first civilian Fly-by-wire aircraft. In the Airbus flight control systems, the computer has the final say on all decisions, meaning the safety of passengers depends upon the accuracy of the software specification, and the competence of the engineering teams producing the (multiple, independent) software stacks. The Strasbourg A320 crash of Jan 21, 1992 is partially related to software in that poor user interface design was a contributing factor.
Failure at Dharan — Patriot Missile clock issue.
