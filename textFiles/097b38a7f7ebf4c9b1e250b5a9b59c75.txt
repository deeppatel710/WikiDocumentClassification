Computational intelligence (CI) is an offshoot of artificial intelligence. As an alternative to GOFAI it rather relies on heuristic algorithms such as in fuzzy systems, neural networks and evolutionary computation. In addition, computational intelligence also embraces techniques that use Swarm intelligence, Fractals and Chaos Theory, Artificial immune systems, Wavelets, etc.
Computational intelligence combines elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and Fuzzy logic (rough sets) to create programs that are, in some sense, intelligent. Computational intelligence research does not reject statistical methods, but often gives a complementary view (as is the case with fuzzy systems). Artificial neural networks is a branch of computational intelligence that is closely related to machine learning.
Computational intelligence is further closely associated with soft computing, connectionist systems and cybernetics.

[edit] The Computational Intelligence Societies
The Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) was established in 2004 (as a name change to the Neural Network society) and is one of the fastest growing societies within the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Subjects in computational intelligence as defined by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society are:

Neural networks
Fuzzy systems
Evolutionary computation, including: genetic algorithms and genetic programming
Swarm intelligence, including particle swarm optimization

The International Society of Intelligent Biological Medicine (ISIBM) aims to use CI to solve biomedical problems. ISIBM hosts annual meeting of IJCBS, the International Journal of Functional Informatics and Personalized Medicine (IJFIPM) and the International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design (IJCBDD).
