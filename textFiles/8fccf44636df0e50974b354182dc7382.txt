In business and engineering, new product development (NPD) is the term used to describe the complete process of bringing a new product or service to market. There are two parallel paths involved in the NPD process: one involves the idea generation, product design, and detail engineering; the other involves market research and marketing analysis. Companies typically see new product development as the first stage in generating and commercializing new products within the overall strategic process of product life cycle management used to maintain or grow their market share.

[edit] The process

Idea Generation is often called the "fuzzy front end" of the NPD process

Ideas for new products can be obtained from basic research using a SWOT analysis (OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS), Market and consumer trends, company's R&D department, competitors, focus groups, employees, salespeople, corporate spies, trade shows, or Ethnographic discovery methods (searching for user patterns and habits) may also be used to get an insight into new product lines or product features.
Idea Generation or Brainstorming of new product, service, or store concepts - idea generation techniques can begin when you have done your OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS to support your ideas in the Idea Screening Phase (shown in the next development step).


Idea Screening

The object is to eliminate unsound concepts prior to devoting resources to them.
The screeners must ask at least three questions:

Will the customer in the target market benefit from the product?
What is the size and growth forecasts of the market segment/target market?
What is the current or expected competitive pressure for the product idea?
What are the industry sales and market trends the product idea is based on?
Is it technically feasible to manufacture the product?
Will the product be profitable when manufactured and delivered to the customer at the target price?




Concept Development and Testing

Develop the marketing and engineering details

Who is the target market and who is the decision maker in the purchasing process?
What product features must the product incorporate?
What benefits will the product provide?
How will consumers react to the product?
How will the product be produced most cost effectively?
Prove feasibility through virtual computer aided rendering, and rapid prototyping
What will it cost to produce it?


Testing the Concept by asking a sample of prospective customers what they think of the idea. Usually via Choice Modelling.


Business Analysis

Estimate likely selling price based upon competition and customer feedback
Estimate sales volume based upon size of market and such tools as the Fourt-Woodlock equation
Estimate profitability and breakeven point


Beta Testing and Market Testing

Produce a physical prototype or mock-up
Test the product (and its packaging) in typical usage situations
Conduct focus group customer interviews or introduce at trade show
Make adjustments where necessary
Produce an initial run of the product and sell it in a test market area to determine customer acceptance


Technical Implementation

New program initiation
Resource estimation
Requirement publication
Engineering operations planning
Department scheduling
Supplier collaboration
Logistics plan
Resource plan publication
Program review and monitoring
Contingencies - what-if planning


Commercialization (often considered post-NPD)

Launch the product
Produce and place advertisements and other promotions
Fill the distribution pipeline with product
Critical path analysis is most useful at this stage



These steps may be iterated as needed. Some steps may be eliminated. To reduce the time that the NPD process takes, many companies are completing several steps at the same time (referred to as concurrent engineering or time to market). Most industry leaders see new product development as a proactive process where resources are allocated to identify market changes and seize upon new product opportunities before they occur (in contrast to a reactive strategy in which nothing is done until problems occur or the competitor introduces an innovation). Many industry leaders see new product development as an ongoing process (referred to as continuous development) in which the entire organization is always looking for opportunities.
For the more innovative products indicated on the diagram above, great amounts of uncertainty and change may exist, which makes it difficult or impossible to plan the complete project before starting it. In this case, a more flexible approach may be advisable.
Because the NPD process typically requires both engineering and marketing expertise, cross-functional teams are a common way of organizing projects. The team is responsible for all aspects of the project, from initial idea generation to final commercialization, and they usually report to senior management (often to a vice president or Program Manager). In those industries where products are technically complex, development research is typically expensive, and product life cycles are relatively short, strategic alliances among several organizations helps to spread the costs, provide access to a wider skill set, and speeds the overall process.
Also, notice that because engineering and marketing expertise are usually both critical to the process, choosing an appropriate blend of the two is important. Observe (for example, by looking at the See also or References sections below) that this article is slanted more toward the marketing side. For more of an engineering slant, see the Ulrich and Eppinger, Ullman references below.[1][2]
People respond to new products in different ways. The adoption of a new technology can be analyzed using a variety of diffusion theories such as the Diffusion of innovations theory.
NewerProducts.com, a blog on newly launched products keeps track of the new products introduced in the market whereby one can analyze the methods used for the introduction of the new product, its marketing plan and its overall success.

[edit] Fuzzy Front End
The Fuzzy Front End is the messy "getting started" period of new product development processes. It is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea. It is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process (Kim and Wilemon , 2002;[3] Koen et al., 2001).[4] It includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept. The Fuzzy Front End ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept.
Although the Fuzzy Front End may not be an expensive part of product development, it can consume 50% of development time (see Chapter 3 of the Smith and Reinertsen reference below),[5] and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time, money, and the product’s nature, thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product. Consequently, this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens “before development,” and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time.
Koen et al. (2001, pp.47-51)[4] distinguish five different front-end elements (not necessarily in a particular order):

Opportunity Identification
Opportunity Analysis
Idea Genesis
Idea Selection
Concept and Technology Development

The first element is the opportunity identification. In this element, large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way. Using the guidelines established here, resources will eventually be allocated to new projects.... which then lead to a structured NPPD (New Product & Process Development)strategy. The second element is the opportunity analysis. It is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company. Here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and/or technical trials and research. The third element is the idea genesis, which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea. The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs, e.g. a supplier offering a new material/technology, or from a customer with an unusual request. The fourth element is the idea selection. Its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value. The fifth element is the concept and technology development. During this part of the front-end, the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market, customer needs, investment requirements, competition analysis and project uncertainty. Some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the NPPD process (i.e., Stage 0).
The Fuzzy Front End is also described in literature as "Front End of Innovation", "Phase 0", "Stage 0" or "Pre-Project-Activities".
A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework has no been developed so far[6] In a glossary of PDMA [1] is mentioned that the Fuzzy Front End generally consists of three tasks: strategic planning, concept generation,and,especially,pre-technical evaluation. These activities are often chaotic,impredictible,and unstructured. In comparison,the subsequent new product development process is typically structured,predictable,and formal. The term Fuzzy Front End was first popularized by Smith and Reinertsen (1991)[7] R.G.Cooper (1988)[8] describes the early stages of NPPD as a four step process in which ideas are generated (I),subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment(II) and merged to coherent product concepts(III) which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios (IV). In a more recent paper , Cooper and Edgett (2008) [9] affirm that vital predevelopment activities include: 1)Preliminary market assessment. 2)Technical assessment. 3)Source-of-supply-assessment:suppliers and partners or alliances. 4)Market research : market size and segmentation analysis,VoC (voice of customer) research. 5.Product concept testing 6.Value-to-the customer assessment 7.Product definition 8.Business and financial analysis. These activities yield vital information to make a Go/No-Go to Development decision. In the in-depth study by Khurana and Rosenthal (1998) [10] front-end activities include product strategy formulation and communication, opportunity identification and assessment,idea generation,product definition,project planning,and executive reviews. Economical analysis, benchmarking of competitive products,and modeling and prototyping are also important activities during the front-end activities. The outcomes of FFE are the mission statement,customer needs,details of the selected concept, product definition and specifications, economic analysis of the product,the development schedule,project staffing and the budget,and a business plan aligned with corporate strategy. In a paper by Husig, Kohn and Huskela (2005)[11] was proposed a conceptual model of Front-End Process which includes early Phases of Innovation Process. This model is structured in three phases and three gates: Phase 1: Environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential business opportunities. Phase 2 : Preliminary definition of an idea or concept. Phase 3 : Detailed product, project or concept definition, and Business planning. The gates are : 1) Opportunity screening;2)Idea evaluation;3) Go/No-Go for development. The final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project . Many professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front End (fuzziness,,ambiguity, and uncertainty) make difficult to see the FFE as a structured process,but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( e.g.Kim and Wilemon ,2002). [12] However, Husig et al,2005 [10] argue that front-end not need to be fuzzy,but can be handled in a structured manner.Peter A.Koen (2004) argue that in the FFE for incremental,platform and radical projects,three separate strategies and processes are typically involved.[13]The traditional Stage Gate (TM) process was designed for incremental product development,namely for a single product.The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision,but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries.It is worth mentioning what are incremental,platform and breakthrough products.Incremental products are considered to be cost reductions,improvements to existing product lines,additions to existing platforms and repositioning of existing products introduced in markets.Breakthrough products are new to the company or new to the world and offer a 5-10 times or greater improvement in performance combined with a 30-50% or greater reduction in costs.Platform products establish a basic architecture for a next generation product or process and are substantially larger in scope and resources than incremental projects (Koen,Peter A.,2004 [12]).
