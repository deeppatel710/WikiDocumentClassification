Component-based software engineering (CBSE) (also known as Component-Based Development (CBD) or Software Componentry) is a branch of the software engineering discipline, with emphasis on decomposition of the engineered systems into functional or logical components with well-defined interfaces used for communication across the components.
Components are considered to be a higher level of abstraction than objects and as such they do not share state and communicate by exchanging messages carrying data.

[edit] Software component
A software component is a system element offering a predefined service or event, and able to communicate with other components. Clemens Szyperski and David Messerschmitt give the following five criteria for what a software component shall be to fulfill the definition:

Multiple-use
Non-context-specific
Composable with other components
Encapsulated i.e., non-investigable through its interfaces
A unit of independent deployment and versioning

A simpler definition can be: A component is an object written to a specification. It does not matter what the specification is: COM, Enterprise JavaBeans, etc., as long as the object adheres to the specification. It is only by adhering to the specification that the object becomes a component and gains features such as reusability.
Software components often take the form of objects or collections of objects (from object-oriented programming), in some binary or textual form, adhering to some interface description language (IDL) so that the component may exist autonomously from other components in a computer.
When a component is to be accessed or shared across execution contexts or network links, techniques such as serialization or marshalling are often employed to deliver the component to its destination.
Reusability is an important characteristic of a high quality software component. A software component should be designed and implemented so that it can be reused in many different programs.
It takes significant effort and awareness to write a software component that is effectively reusable. The component needs to be:

fully documented
more thoroughly tested -

robust - with comprehensive input validity checking
able to pass back appropriate error messages or return codes


designed with an awareness that it will be put to unforeseen uses

In the 1960s, scientific subroutine libraries were built that were reusable in a broad array of engineering and scientific applications. Though these subroutine libraries reused well-defined algorithms in an effective manner, they had a limited domain of application. Commercial sites routinely created application programs from reuseable modules written in Assembler,COBOL,PL/1 and other 2nd and third generation languages using both System and user application libraries.
Today, modern reusable components encapsulate both data structures and the algorithms that are applied to the data structures. It builds on prior theories of software objects, software architectures, software frameworks and software design patterns, and the extensive theory of object-oriented programming and the object oriented design of all these. It claims that software components, like the idea of hardware components, used for example in telecommunications, can ultimately be made interchangeable and reliable.

[edit] History
The idea that software should be componentized, built from prefabricated components, was first published in Douglas McIlroy's address at the NATO conference on software engineering in Garmisch, Germany, 1968 titled Mass Produced Software Components. This conference set out to counter the so-called software crisis. His subsequent inclusion of pipes and filters into the Unix operating system was the first implementation of an infrastructure for this idea.
The modern concept of a software component was largely defined by Brad Cox of Stepstone, who called them Software ICs and set out to create an infrastructure and market for these components by inventing the Objective-C programming language. (He summarizes this view in his book Object-Oriented Programming - An Evolutionary Approach 1986.)
IBM led the path with their System Object Model (SOM) in the early 1990s. Some claim that Microsoft paved the way for actual deployment of component software with OLE and COM. Today, many successful software component models exist.

[edit] Differences from object-oriented programming
The idea in object-oriented programming (OOP) is that software should be written according to a mental model of the actual or imagined objects it represents. OOP and the related disciplines of object-oriented design and object-oriented analysis focus on modeling real-world[citation needed] interactions and attempting to create 'verbs' and 'nouns' which can be used in intuitive[citation needed] ways, ideally by end users as well as by programmers coding for those end users.
Component-based software engineering, by contrast, makes no such assumptions, and instead states that software should be developed by gluing prefabricated components together much like in the field of electronics or mechanics. Some peers[who?] will even talk of modularizing systems as software components as a new programming paradigm.
Some argue that this distinction was made by earlier computer scientists, with Donald Knuth's theory of "literate programming" optimistically assuming there was convergence between intuitive and formal models, and Edsger Dijkstra's theory in the article The Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science, which stated that programming was simply, and only, a branch of mathematics.
In both forms, this notion has led to many academic debates about the pros and cons of the two approaches and possible strategies for uniting the two. Some consider them not really competitors, but only descriptions of the same problem from two different points of view.

[edit] Architecture
A computer running several software components is often called an application server. Using this combination of application servers and software components is usually called distributed computing. The usual real-world application of this is in financial applications or business software.
