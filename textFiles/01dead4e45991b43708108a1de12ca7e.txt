AutoIt (pronounced aw-tow-it)[1] is a freeware automation language for Microsoft Windows. In its earliest release, the software was primarily intended to create automation scripts (sometimes called macros) for Microsoft Windows programs.[2] Such scripts proved useful for "hands-free" completion of highly repetitive tasks, such as rolling out a large number of PCs with identical installation instructions. With later releases, AutoIt grew to include enhancements in both programming language design and overall functionality.
With the release of AutoIt version 3, the syntax of the programming language was restructured to be more like the BASIC family of languages. A script can be compiled into a compressed, stand-alone executable which can then be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed.
A wide range of function libraries (known as UDF's, or "User Defined Functions")[3] are included as standard or available from the website to add specialized functionality.

AutoIt, like other scripting languages, is a third-generation programming language using a classical data model, utilizing a variant data type that can store several types of data, including arrays. It has a BASIC-like syntax and is compatible with Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/2003/Vista, However support for operating systems older than Windows 2000 has been dropped as of Autoit v3.3.0.
AutoIt is distributed with an IDE based on the free SciTE editor. The compiler and help text are fully integrated and provide a de facto standard environment for developers using AutoIt.

[edit] Usage





This section may stray from the topic of the article.
Please help improve this section or discuss this issue on the talk page.


A popular use of AutoIt is the production of utility software for Microsoft Windows. Common tasks, such as website monitoring, network monitoring, disk defragging and backup, can be automated and combined to provide a customised utility.
Another use of AutoIt is for "botting" in online games. Botting allows the user to run a script which automates some repetitive action in the game - usually so the script user can advance in the game more quickly. Use of AutoIt in this way is frowned upon by some in the AutoIt community as it can generate bad publicity; however, a few botting scripts can still be found in the official AutoIt forums. Because botting is considered to be cheating by most AutoIt users you should not expect much help in the use of AutoIt for this purpose. Many forum members will refuse to help those that are trying to create bots. This is not to say that support will not be provided; however, you may have to wait long periods of time for answers regarding bots.
It is also used to simulate application users, whereby an application is driven by an AutoIt script in place of manual application control during software testing.
It has also been used to create malware.[4]

[edit] Short History

Christmas 1998 - Idea of C program that should send keystrokes
January 1999 - First AutoIt Version (1.0)
August 1999 - AutoIt v2 and AutoItX
September 1999 - First AutoIt version with Compiler
December 2002 - AutoIt v3 (Public Beta)
February 2004 - AutoIt v3 (Stable)
September 2006 - Auto3Lib started
November 2007 - AutoIt v3.2.10.0 released, Auto3Lib incorporated into AutoIt v3
May 2008 - AutoIt v3.2.12.0 released, incorporating added GUI functionality
December 2008 - AutoIt (and AutoItX) v3.3.0.0 released

NOTE: At some point in the life of AutoIt (around version 2), the developers released the source code under the GPL license in hopes to accelerate development.[5] Soon, however, a few individuals[who?] took the code and released their own competing products using a non-GPL license while giving no credit to the original AutoIt developers[citation needed]. The AutoIt developers decided to prevent such pilfering for future versions of AutoIt and changed the license and limited access to the source code[citation needed]. The release of source code was stopped beginning with version 3.2.0 in August 2006.[citation needed]
