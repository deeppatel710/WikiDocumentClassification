[edit] Target audience
Designers are the principal users, creating and laying out periodical publications, posters, and print media. Longer documents are often still designed with Adobe's FrameMaker (manuals, technical documents, etc.) or with QuarkXPress (books, catalogs, etc.). Using a relational database, the Adobe InCopy word processor uses the same formatting engine as InDesign.
InDesign is a direct competitor to QuarkXPress.

[edit] History
InDesign is the successor and alternative to Adobe's own PageMaker, which was acquired with the purchase of Aldus in late 1994. By 1998 PageMaker had lost almost the entire professional market to the comparatively feature-rich QuarkXPress 4.1, released in 1996. Quark stated its intention to buy out Adobe and to divest the combined company of PageMaker to avoid anti-trust issues. Adobe rebuffed the offer and instead worked on a project built independently of PageMaker, code-named "K2", and released as InDesign 1.0 in 1999.
In 2002, InDesign was the first Mac OS X-native desktop publishing (DTP) software. In version 3 (InDesign CS) it received a boost in distribution by being bundled with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat in the Creative Suite.
InDesign exports documents in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) and has multilingual support. It was the first DTP application to support Unicode for text processing, advanced typography with OpenType fonts, advanced transparency features, layout styles, optical margin alignment, and cross-platform scripting using JavaScript.
Later versions of the software introduced new file formats. To support the new features, especially typographic, introduced with InDesign CS, both the program and its document format are not backward-compatible. Instead, InDesign CS2 has the backward-compatible .inx format, an XML-based document representation. InDesign CS versions updated with the 3.01 April 2005 update can read InDesign CS2-saved files exported to the .inx format. The InDesign Interchange format does not support versions earlier than InDesign CS.
Adobe developed InDesign CS3 (and Creative Suite 3) as universal binary software compatible with native Intel and PowerPC Mac machines in 2007, two years after the announced 2005 schedule. Inconveniencing Intel-Mac early-adopters, Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen announced that "Adobe will be first with a complete line of universal applications."[1] The CS2 Mac version had code tightly integrated to the PPC architecture, and not natively compatible with the Intel processors in Apple's new machines, so porting the products to another platform was more difficult than had been anticipated. Adobe developed the CS3 application integrating Macromedia products (2005), rather than recompiling CS2 and simultaneously developing CS3.
According to analysts, CS4, released in 2008, seems to be not selling well.[2]

[edit] InDesign and Leopard
InDesign up to version CS3 does not seem to work correctly on Leopard (Mac OS X v10.5), as Adobe states: "InDesign CS3 may unexpectedly quit when using the Place, Save, Save As or Export commands using either the OS or Adobe dialog boxes. Unfortunately, there are no workarounds for these known issues." [3]
In forums this workaround has been reported to work.
Thus far, InDesign CS4 works fine on Leopard.

[edit] Server Version




InDesign CS3 Server icon


In October 2005, Adobe released "InDesign Server CS2", a modified version of InDesign (without user interface) for Windows and Macintosh server platforms. It does not provide any editing client; rather it is for use by developers in creating client-server solutions with the InDesign plug-in technology.[4] In March 2007 Adobe officially announced Adobe InDesign CS3 Server as part of the Adobe InDesign family.

[edit] Internationalization and localization

[edit] Language availability
Adobe InDesign CS3 is available in the following languages: Arabic (Middle Eastern version), Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, French (Canadian), German, Greek, Hebrew (Middle Eastern version), Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Spanish (Latin American), Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.[5]
Adobe InDesign Middle Eastern language versions available from WinSoft.[6].

[edit] Specific features for Arabic (also Persian) and Hebrew languages
The Middle Eastern/Hebrew and the Middle Eastern/Arabic versions are specifically developed for Arabic and Hebrew languages.

[edit] Text settings
InDesign Middle Eastern versions come with special settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text, such as:

Ability to use Arabic, Persian or Hindi digits
Use kashidas for letter spacing and full justification
Ligature option
Set vowels/diacritics positioning
Justify text in three possible ways to get the desired results (Standard, Arabic, Naskh)
Option to "Insert Special Character": three Hebrew characters (Geresh, Gershayim, Magaf) and an Arabic one (Kashida)
Apply standard, Arabic or Hebrew styles for page, paragraph and footnote numbering


[edit] Bi-directional text flow
In InDesign Middle Eastern versions, the notion of right-to-left behaviour applies to several objects: Story, Paragraph, Character and Table. You can easily mix Right-to-Left and Left-to-Right Words, Paragraphs and Stories in a document.

InDesign CS3 Middle Eastern versions allow you to change in one click the direction of neutral characters (for ex.: ,/?, etc.) according to your keyboard language.


[edit] Table of contents
You can create a table of contents (TOC) for any document or book in InDesign Middle Eastern versions. InDesign Middle Eastern versions come with a set of Table of contents titles, one for each supported language. The TOC is also sorted according to the chosen language. InDesign CS3 Middle Eastern versions allow you to choose the language of your index title and cross-references by right clicking in the title field in the Generate Index window.

[edit] Indexes
You can create a simple keyword index or a comprehensive, detailed guide to the information in your book. InDesign Middle Eastern versions let you set various Sort Options for your indexes according to the language you are dealing with.

[edit] Importing and exporting
InDesign Middle Eastern versions bring the capability of opening directly and converting QuarkXPress files, even using Arabic XT, Arabic Phonyx or Hebrew XPressWay fonts, retaining the layout and content. InDesign Middle Eastern versions come with more than 50 import/export filters enabling you to place many kinds of images and Roman texts: Microsoft Word 97-98-2000 Import filter and Text Import filter.

[edit] Reverse layout
InDesign Middle Eastern versions include a reverse layout feature to revert the layout of a document, when converting a Left to Right document (Roman) to a Right to Left one (Arabic or Hebrew) or vice versa. It is also helpful when creating a multilingual document.

The Middle Eastern versions are also available for Adobe Acrobat [7], Adobe Illustrator [8], Adobe Photoshop [9], Adobe InCopy [10] and Adobe Dreamweaver [11], for Adobe Creative Suite [12] (Design Standard, Design Premium, Web Premium).

[edit] Complex Script Rendering
Although InDesign supports Unicode character encoding, and there is a special Middle East version supporting complex text layout for Arabic and Hebrew scripts, current versions do not support complex script rendering for the Indic scripts used to write the languages of India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, South East Asia, or rendering other types of complex script.
