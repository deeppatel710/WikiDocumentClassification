WinBuilder is a free application designed to build and customize boot disks (Live CDs) based on Microsoft Windows.
The main advantage of WinBuilder is the relative ease of use, friendly GUI, and the ongoing community effort to further automate and develop the customization of these boot disks[citation needed].
Boot disks are based on projects and scripts that can produce very different results, depending on the expected result from the end user.
