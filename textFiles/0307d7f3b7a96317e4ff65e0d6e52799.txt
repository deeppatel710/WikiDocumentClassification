An AKAI MPC2000 sampler


Akai MPCs (originally MIDI Production Center, now Music Production Center) are a popular and well respected series of electronic musical instruments originally designed by Roger Linn and produced by the Japanese company Akai from 1988 onwards. Intended to function as a powerful kind of drum machine, the MPCs drew on design ideas from machines such as the Sequential Circuits Inc. Studio 440 and the Linn's own Linn 9000, combining a powerful MIDI sequencer with the ability to sample one's own sounds. Later models feature increasingly powerful sampling, storage, interfacing and sound manipulation facilities, which broaden the use of instrument beyond just drum and rhythm tracks.

[edit] History
The original MPC60 was designed by Roger Linn, who was hired as a design consultant by Akai. He developed the functional design, including the panel layout and software/hardware specifications. He then created the software with a team of engineers. The hardware electronics were designed by English engineer David Cockerell and his team.[1] Cockerell was a founder member of the synthesizer firm EMS (co-creater of their famous VCS3 along with Peter Zinovieff,[2]), and had then worked for effects manufacturers Electro-Harmonix.
Shortly after the MPC60's release, the MPC60-II was designed. Released in 1991, the MPC60-II offered most of the same features as the MPC60, with an added headphone output and a plastic housing replacing the original metal one.[3] In 1994, Akai released the MPC3000, which boasted 16-bit, 44 kHz sampling, 32-voice polyphony, and SCSI data transfer.[4] Akai developed and released the MPC2000 without Linn in 1997.[1] It came with 2 MB of RAM, an optional effects board, and a 100,000 note 64-track sequencer.[5] The MPC2000 was replaced by the MPC2000XL in 2000. The MPC2000XL added an improved 300,000 note sequencer, a 64-track mixer and time-stretch and resample features. Four limited edition models of the MPC2000XL were released.[5]
In 2002 Akai unveiled the MPC4000, the most powerful MPC at the time. The MPC4000 featured 8 assignable outputs, a hard drive and CD-ROM drive. The MPC4000's memory could be expanded to up to 512 MB of RAM, the largest amount on an MPC to date.[6] Only two years after the release of the MPC4000, Akai released the MPC1000, which was the smallest in the MPC product line at the time of its release. It was also the first MPC to utilize CompactFlash memory.[7]. Both the MPC2500 and the MPC500 were added to the Akai MPC series in 2006. The MPC2500 is a mid-range MPC with 8 assignable outputs and CompactFlash storage.[8] Designed for portability, the MPC500 features 1 MIDI In/Out and CompactFlash storage, and can be powered by 6 AA batteries.[9]

[edit] MPC Models
The following MPC models are arranged in the order of their release date:

[edit] MPC60
The MPC60 was a 16 voice polyphonic 12-bit 40 kHz sampler / 99 track sequencer designed in large part by Roger Linn after Linn Electronics closed. It was similar to the Linn 9000. Akai released it in 1988. It had 750 kB memory standard, expandable to 1.5 MB. The sequencer is very flexible and powerful, famous both for its "swing" setting, and its easy to use step programming. It had 2 MIDI inputs / 4 MIDI outputs, allowing it to control up to 64 devices. The sequencer itself was offered as a separate product, known as the ASQ10, also released in 1988. The MPC60-II was nearly identical to the MPC60, but it featured a headphone output, and a plastic case, instead of the metal case of the original. It was released in 1991.

MPC2000XL SE 2


The MPC2000XL is similar to the MPC2000 but with added features; including four pad-bank keys, time stretch along with other new features. In 2004 the 2000XL-MCD version was released, which features a CompactFlash card reader as standard in place of the floppy drive or Zip drives used in earlier models.[10] There were 4 limited edition 2000XL SE MPCs created between 2000 and 2003. There were two versions of the SE 1, one with an improved control surface, compatible with growing number of sound libraries and one with aesthetic changes. The Limited Edition SE 2 and SE 3 also had only aesthetic changes.[11] The 4 SE models can be seen here: http://www.loopers-delight.com/tools/akai/MPC2000/MPC2000.html.

SCSI interface[5]


[edit] MPC4000
Released in 2002, the MPC4000 was intended by Akai as a "top-of-the-range" flagship product. Not only was it the most fully-featured MPC product yet (building on the MPC60, 3000 and 2000XL), but it also incorporated the sampling engine from the latest model in Akai standalone sampler range (the Z8, building on the legacy of Akai's well-respected S-series samplers). Today the MPC 4000 has disappeared from the AKAI Product pages, supposedly because it was not a great sales success and is therefore replaced by the more market orientated MPC 5000 which was released in spring 2008.
The MPC4000 gained some notoriety amongst users for having a bug-ridden OS and poor product support, with some originally advertised product features still not implemented in 2006.
Features

16 velocity and pressure sensitive pads
2 MIDI inputs, 4 MIDI outputs
96 kHz 24bit sampling
16 MB sampling memory, upgradeable to 512 MB
IDE bays for installation of internal hard disk drive and CD-ROM drive.
Optional plug-in boards: Effects board, ADAT board, S/P-DIF & wordclock board, 8 analogue outputs board
SCSI interface[6]


[edit] MPC2500
The MPC2500 is the mid-range of the Akai line of MPCs. It has a 100,000 note, 64 track mixer with 64 assignable MIDI channels. It has 16 MB of RAM standard and can be upgraded up to 128 MB of RAM with the AKAI EXM128 stick of RAM. It contains an USB port for computer connectivity. It contains a CompactFlash slot for storage of samples, and can be upgraded with a variety of hard drives. The MPC2500 contains 2 MIDI inputs and 4 MIDI outputs. The MP2500 also has the Chop Shop feature, which can chop a sample into as many as 64 pieces. A CD drive can added for burning and reading capabilities. Also comes with a 128 mb compact flash card with sound kits.
Features

USB port (Mass Storage Class)
CompactFlash card reader
16 velocity sensitive pads
2 MIDI inputs, 4 MIDI outputs
100,000 note, 64-track, MIDI sequencer
16 MB sampling memory (upgradeable to 128 MB)
Included standard effects include:Chorus, Flanger, Bit grunger, 4 band EQ, Compressor, Phase shifter, Tremolo, Flying Pan, Reverb, and Delay.
It contains 8 assignable outputs and 1 stereo output.
It has two assignable Q-link sliders and knobs.
240 x 64 hinged backlit LCD screen.
The CD-M25 CD Drive can added.
JJOS compatible[8]


[edit] MPC1000
The MPC1000 is a 64-track sampler/sequencer. It comes with 16 MB sample memory as standard, and can be expanded to 128 MB. It supports a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, in stereo or mono. Its features include a USB port, an internal CompactFlash card reader, two MIDI inputs and outputs, and effects and multiple analog outputs as standard. Its sequencer's resolution is 96 ppq.
There have been wide spread problems with the pad sensors in the 1000. In the original MPC1000 sensors, a thin square of carbon-impregnated rubber is attached above a copper coil. When a pad is depressed, this carbon-impregnated rubber is compressed against the copper coil, allowing current to pass through.
In 2007, Akai offered a pad upgrade to add improved performance, retailing at 180 USD. The pad sensors design returned to the design of the pad sensors in previous models. This upgrade has been seen to be pre-installed on the MPC1000BK-N and some versions of the MPC1000BK, not the MPC1000 (blue outer casing). Before this pad problem was eventually fixed by Akai, a MPC 1000 user designed, built and sold kits of a pad fix under the name "Nym." Nym's kit is no longer available. By comparison, the more recent Akai pad fix uses better sensor technology (Sensitronic FSRs).[12]

Features

USB port (Mass Storage Class)
CompactFlash card reader
16 velocity sensitive pads
4 pad bank keys
2 MIDI inputs, 2 MIDI outputs
100,000 note capacity 64-track sequencer
16 MB sampling memory (upgradeable to 128 MB)
Effects as standard
Multiple analog outputs as standard
Timestretch and pitch shift (added in OS 2.0)
JJOS compatible[7]


[edit] MPC500
The MPC500 is the smallest MPC ever made and is the first truly portable MPC created. It can be run on 6 AA batteries but also can be run on a 12V DC plug. It combines a 48-track MIDI sequencer and a 32-voice stereo digital sampler. The MPC500 is the first MPC that only has 12 velocity sensitive rubber pads. It comes with 16 MB RAM but can be upgraded up to 128 MB of RAM. It has a CompactFlash slot for storage of samples. One major appeal of the MPC500 is the fact that you can take a project created on the MPC500 and transfer it to any current MPC with a CompactFlash reader. The MPC500 has a USB port for computer connectivity. It has one stereo output, making it the only MPC currently in production that does not have assignable outputs.
Features

USB port (Mass Storage Class)
CompactFlash card reader
12 velocity sensitive rubber pads
Stereo L+R in & out
1 MIDI in and 1 MIDI out
4 pad banks
2 x 16 character LCD screen with back light
Standard effects include:Chorus, Flanger, Bit grunger, 4 band EQ, Compressor, Phase shifter, Tremolo, Flying pan, Reverb, and Delay.
Approximately 4.5 hours of continuous use with LCD backlight on.
465.5 sq CM footprint.[9]


[edit] MPC5000
The MPC5000 was launched at the 2008 winter NAMM trade show. Its main innovations are an 8-track streaming hard disk recorder, a 20-voice, 3-oscillator virtual analog synthesizer with arpeggiator, a new sequencing engine with 960 ppq resolution, pad and track muting and mixing, 64 continuous sample tracks. It also has a new FX engine with 4 FX buses and 2FX per bus, and is considered by Akai to be its flagship MPC[13].
In addition, the MPC5000 features a 64-voice drum/phrase sampler with 64MB memory, expandable up to 192MB. The display is 240x128, twice the size of the MPC2500 and MPC1000, but smaller than the one on the MPC 4000 . Integrated Chop Shop 2.0 now supports stereo chops and Patched Phrases. It is also the first MPC to include Random and Cycle sample playback in addition to velocity Zone Play. A turntable preamp is also included, as on the MPC 4000.
Although being marketed as "the ultimate MPC", the MPC 5000 lacks some of the advanced sample editing capabilities of the older MPC 4000. Also, some of its hardware specs are lower (max. 192 MB RAM vs. the 4000's 512 MB, smaller screen), despite the falling prices of hardware since the 4000's 2002 launch. The numbers-to-numbers comparison of specifications has resulted in some unfavorable comparisons on the MPC community forums.

[edit] JJ Operating System
In the summer of 2006, an anonymous programmer believed to be an ex-Akai employee released a 3rd party OS for the MPC 1000 and later for the MPC 2500. This programmer was nicknamed "JJ" or "Japanese Jenius" by an enthusiastic fan/beta tester.
This new software boasts superior features to those of the original OS and also fixes a number of bugs in the Akai software.[21]. Collective additions include "midi grid edit" (piano roll), extensive qlink support, audio tracks, aftertouch, portamento, and innumerable performance and system tweaks. The demo version lacks a save capability, which is unlocked with the purchase of a password for $50.
As a programmer, JJ is characterized by his frequent updates and attentiveness to customer feedback. Despite a significant language barrier (Japanese-English) JJ OS users maintain a steady stream of dialog with the programmer. This steady flow of dialog between the user and the programmer is further maintained through the ability to report a bug in the system directly to JJ through the "Report a Bug" link on the JJ OS website.
In late December, 2007, JJ released a beta version of OS 2, which has since gone gold. This version gives the 1000 and 2500 features[22] found on the more expensive MPC 4000, such as ADSR for pitch, amp and filter, keymaps etc. On March 11th, 2008, The 1.0 version of OS2 was released, adding more sound editing possibilities, including: fade in and out, and combine of two sounds. It also added audio track improvements, which mainly focused around the ability to apply pads to markers with in an audio track. These are just some examples of improvements made in the 1.0 version. [23]
There is an extended community of users of all of the versions of the JJ operating system on mpc-forums.com (MPC 1000 and MPC 2500)
There are three different versions of the JJ OS available for download.

[edit] JJ OS 3.08 (free)
This version is the most similar to the Akai OS, and does not include many new features, however it has fixed a series of bugs.

[edit] JJ OS1
A version of "OS1" which is the most stable version of the all of the JJ OS's. The user must purchase a password for $30.00 US dollars (or $40 for the MPC 2500). OS1 is currently in version 4.99B. The most recent MPC 2500 version (10.16.2008) is 5.55.
Features

LED Screen
Velocity Trigger Qlinks
Effects Modulation
Insert Silence
Increased Sound Editing through TRIM mode
MIDI Time Clock (MTC) and MIDI Machine Control (MMC)
MIDI, 6 and 16 pad DRAM, Q-Link, and audio Grid Edit
Simult Sequence
Recordable Track Mutes [24]


[edit] JJ OS2
The second version of the JJ OS is OS2, which was released in beta form in late December 2007. Many of these features that have been added by OS2 have been compared to features included in the high-end MPC 4000. Like OS1, it can be downloaded and tried free of charge, but users are unable to save. This can be unlocked by purchasing a password for OS2, however, users are unable to install OS2 unless they already have installed an unlocked version of OS1 first. On March 11th 2008 version 1.0 was released[23], and as of 04.08.2008, the JJOS2 is available for both the MPC1000(v1.06) and the MPC2500(v1.04), with both costing $49.
Features

Filter, Amp, and Pitch ADSR envelopes
Aftertouch
Multi-sample instrument programs including portamento
Sample Layer Crossfade
Non-destructive Chop
Track Mixer
Pad Pattern
Fade in and out
Grid Edit Loop Edit
Improved audio tracks including audio markers and start offset [24]


[edit] JJ OS2XL
The latest version of the JJ OS was released January 27, 2009. 66 new functions have been added.
