Brook Busey (born June 14, 1978), better known by the pen name Diablo Cody,[1] is an American Academy Award & BAFTA-winning screenwriter, writer, blogger, journalist and author. First known for her candid chronicling of her year as a stripper in her Pussy Ranch blog and her 2006 memoir, Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper, Cody won wider fame as the writer of the 2007 film Juno, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
Cody wrote a horror-drama screenplay about a teenage cannibal called Jennifer's Body during the filming, and promotion, of Juno. Jennifer's Body was filmed from 2007 to 2008 and is set for a September 2009 release.
A sitcom created by Cody, called United States of Tara, based on an idea by Steven Spielberg, has been picked up for 13 episodes (including pilot) by the U.S. cable TV network Showtime and Canadian channel The Movie Network.[2]. After the airing of only 4 episodes, the show was renewed for a second season [3].

[edit] Early life and career
Cody, who took the pen name Diablo Cody (diablo is Spanish for "devil") after repeatedly listening to the song El Diablo by Arcadia[4] while passing through Cody, Wyoming,[5] attended Benet Academy, a Roman Catholic school in Lisle, Illinois. Cody, and her older brother Marc grew up in Lemont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. She graduated from the University of Iowa with a media studies degree.[6] While at the University of Iowa, Cody was a DJ at KRUI 89.7 FM. Her first jobs were doing secretarial work at a Chicago law firm and later proofreading copy for advertisements that played on Twin Cities radio stations.
Cody began a parody of a weblog called Red Secretary, detailing the (fictional) exploits of a secretary living in Belarus.[7] The events were thinly-veiled allegories for events that happened in Cody's real life, but told from the perspective of a disgruntled, English-idiom-challenged Eastern Bloc girl.
Cody's first bona fide blog appeared under the nickname Darling Girl after Cody had moved from Chicago to Minneapolis, Minnesota.[7] Cody currently resides in Los Angeles.[8]

[edit] Stripping and journalism
On a whim, Cody signed up for amateur night at a Minneapolis strip club called the Skyway Lounge.[6] Enjoying the experience, she eventually quit her day job and took up stripping full-time.[9] Cody also spent time working peep shows at Sex World, a Minneapolis adult novelty and DVD store. Cody soon made a retreat to journalism, and a budding writing career stimulated by her skin trade days.
While still stripping, Cody began writing for City Pages, an alternative Twin Cities weekly newspaper.[6] She left City Pages just before it changed editorial hands. Cody has since written for the now-defunct Jane magazine. In December 2007, Cody debuted as Entertainment Weekly magazine's newest Backpage columnist, joining regular contributors Mark Harris and the iconic pop horror author Stephen King on a rotational basis.
At the age of 24, Cody wrote her memoir Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper. The memoir began after Mason Novick, who would soon become Cody's manager, showed interest in Cody's acerbic wit. Based on the popularity Pussy Ranch had received, he was able to secure her a publishing contract with Gotham Books.

[edit] Screenwriting
After completion of her book, Cody was encouraged by Novick to write her first screenplay.[5] Within months she wrote Juno, a coming-of-age story about a teenager's unplanned pregnancy. The Jason Reitman-directed comedy stars Ellen Page and Michael Cera.
In July 2007, Showtime announced that it would be producing a pilot of Cody's Dreamworks television series, United States of Tara. Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg, Tara is a comedy about a mother with dissociative identity disorder, starring Toni Collette.[8] The series began filming in Spring 2008, and premiered on January 18, 2009.
In October 2007, Cody sold a script titled Girly Style to Universal Studios, and a horror script called Jennifer's Body to Fox Atomic.[10] Set for release on September 18, 2009, Jennifer's Body stars Megan Fox as the title character.[11] Cody also partially wrote the script for Burlesque, a musical film by director/screenwriter Steven Antin.[12]
Cody is good friends with fellow screenwriters Dana Fox (What Happens in Vegas) and Lorene Scafaria (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist) and they often write their screenplays while hanging out together in order to get advice from one another. [13]

Juno was runner-up for the Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award, won second prize at the Rome Film Festival, and earned four Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. Cody herself won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for her debut script, which also picked up a Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. She also won screenplay honors from BAFTA, the Writers Guild of America, Broadcast Film Critics Association, the National Board of Review, the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association, the Florida Film Critics Circle, the Southeastern Film Critics Association, and the Satellite Awards, the Cinema for Peace Award 2008 for Most Valuable Work of Director, Producer & Screenwriter for Juno.
