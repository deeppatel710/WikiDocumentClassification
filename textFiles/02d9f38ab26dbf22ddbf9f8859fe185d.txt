[edit] Early life and work
Born in Paris, France to Iranian parents, Omidyar moved to the US at the age of six. Growing up in Washington, D.C., he developed an interest in computing while at St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated from St. Andrew's in 1984, and in 1988, he graduated with a degree in computer science from Tufts University. Shortly after, Omidyar went to work for Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary, where he helped write MacDraw. In 1991 he co-founded Ink Development, a pen-based computing startup that was later rebranded as an e-commerce company and renamed eShop.

[edit] eBay and later career
Omidyar was 28 when he sat down over a long holiday weekend to write the original computer code for what eventually became an Internet superbrand — the auction site eBay. The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar's fiancée trade PEZ candy dispensers was fabricated by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media. This was revealed in Adam Cohen's 2002 book[2] and confirmed by eBay.
The site was launched on Labor Day, Monday, September 4, 1995, under the more prosaic title of "Auction Web"; it was hosted on a site Omidyar had created for information on the ebola virus. Auction Web was later renamed "eBay", after Echo Bay, Omidyar's consulting firm, when "echobay.com" was unavailable. The service was free at first, but started charging in order to cover Internet service provider costs.
Jeffrey Skoll joined the company in 1996. In March 1998, Meg Whitman was brought in as President and CEO and continued to run the company till Jan 2008 when she announced her retirement. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, making both Omidyar and Skoll billionaires. As of July 2008, Omidyar's 178 million eBay shares were worth around $4.45 billion.[3] With eBay's stock plummeting in recent months, Omidyar's eBay shares are now worth closer to $3 billion.

[edit] Omidyar Network
Main article: Omidyar Network
Omidyar Network is a philanthropic investment firm that is committed to creating and fostering opportunity for people around the world. The organization makes both grants and investments, identifying likeminded organizations to support, scale, and champion to maximize their social impact. Omidyar Network's work is based on the belief that business can create extraordinary opportunity and value, and that market-based solutions can generate significant social returns. The Network recognizes sustainability, innovation, and scale as hallmarks of the private sector that are critical to addressing the global challenges we face today.
Prior to founding eBay, Pierre co-founded Ink Development Corp., later renamed eShop and acquired by Microsoft. After graduating from Tufts with a B.S. in computer science, he joined Claris, a subsidiary of Apple Computer, as a consumer software engineer. Today, Pierre serves as a trustee of Tufts University, Punahou School and Santa Fe Institute, a director of Meetup, and chairman of eBay Inc.
Mr. Omidyar is also a private owner of Montage Resort & Spa in Laguna Beach, California.
