From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to: navigation, search 
The version history of iPhone OS begins with the release of the iPhone on 29 June 2007. This operating system from Apple Inc. did not have an official name until the release of the iPhone SDK on 6 March 2008. Before then, Apple marketing literature simply stated that the iPhone runs "OS X", a reference to iPhone OS's parent, Mac OS X.[1] The current version of iPhone OS is 2.2.1. The Developer Beta for version 3.0 was made available on 17 March 2009 ; iPhone OS 3.0 is slated to ship in mid-2009.
Apple provides updates to the iPhone's and iPod Touch's operating system through iTunes, similar to the way that other iPods are updated, and touts this as an advantage compared to other mobile phones and devices.[2] Security patches, as well as new and improved features, are released in this fashion.[3]
Apple concurrently provides the same version of the iPhone OS for the iPod Touch. iPhone users receive all software updates free, but iPod Touch users are charged for some major software updates.

Apple did warn developers that an issue with beta 3 of iPhone Software 3.0 will prevent them from running iPhone apps that have been compiled for earlier version of the iPhone software, but said it hopes to resolve the issue with the release of the next beta.
